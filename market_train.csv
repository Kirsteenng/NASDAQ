Huahua has been a financial and marketing partner for past Paramount films, such as ""Transformers: Age of Extinction."" The Chinese company had agreed to be acquired by Oriental Time Media for about $158 million, but regulatory concerns reportedly caused OTM to withdraw its offer on March 9. Sources told The Wrap this would most likely prevent Huahua from funding Paramount\'s film slate. That is a major blow to the studio that is in dire straits after a disappointing 2016 at the box office, coming in behind all of the Hollywood major studios in revenue for the last five years. Paramount Chief Executive Brad Gray announced in February he would step down as Viacom\'s new CEO Bob Bakish laid out a plan to turn around the company that includes focusing on getting Paramount Pictures back on track.

The move broke the stock out of a falling wedge and through lateral resistance at the December high just above $19, a level that has been keeping the stock at bay for about a year and a half.

At present, The Arora Report has a small position in SCO as a hedge.', u' What to do now ', u'Please note that there is an 80% probability that oil prices won\u2019t slide 40%.

', u' Still good growth options: While some picks are seeing top-line pressures, many biotech stocks have growth stories that are unmatched elsewhere on Wall Street. Take Celgene Corp.

Of course, some one-time charges held back profits, but excluding those items, earnings jumped 36%. Admittedly, growth might not match the go-go days of years past, but the question going forward is simply whether the growth is promising enough vs. the alternatives in a challenging market.', u' Biotechs are fairly priced: It\u2019s also important to remember that because of Wall Street\u2019s negative view on biotech, these stocks have been deeply discounted vs. prior norms in the sector. Take one-time darling Biogen Inc.

Sure, Biogen saw a nearly flat top line and another slide in profits when it reported fourth-quarter numbers recently. But after struggling for a while, it now trades at a little more than 12 times next year\u2019s earnings.

Many biotechs are focused on \u201corphan\u201d drugs where patients have no other options, such as BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.                                                                                                                                                                                                           BMRN, +0.40%                                                                                                                                                 which has gone after rare genetic disorders. This grants them a virtual monopoly when treatments prove successful. Furthermore, these drugs aren\'t discretionary expenses that will be cut back on when times get lean. Patients will do whatever they can to afford treatments that improve their quality of life, and that means recession-proof revenue for biotech in a time when many industries are facing uncertainty.', u' Buyout bait: The hope of a big buyout premium has lured many investors into smaller biotech stocks over the years. Sometimes those deals never transpire, but in 2017, those hopes of big-time acquisitions could prove well-founded. As I wrote recently, there was a record $1.7 trillion in M&amp;A last year, with 80% of that going toward strategic deals by competitors or peers. That trend is sure to continue this year, particularly with a more sympathetic regulatory environment in Washington. ', u'It\u2019s also worth pointing out that while many investors focus on Big Pharma heavyweights loaded with cash \u2014 such as Pfizer Inc.

With big-time cash at the top of the food chain and smaller biotech stocks trading at relatively low levels compared with prior years, 2017 may be a big year for consolidation in the space.']","['sure', 'continue', 'particularly', 'sympathetic', 'regulatory', 'environment', 'Washington', 'u', 'It', 'u', 'pointing', u'investor', 'focus', 'Big', 'Pharma', u'heavyweight', 'loaded', 'u', 'Pfizer', 'Inc', 'PFE', 'xa', 'sitting', 'roughly', u'investment', 'u', 'smaller', u'player', 'sitting', 'big', 'war', u'chest', 'Case', 'point', 'Gilead', 'Sciences', 'Inc', 'GILD', u'investment', 'present']",0.0

Here\u2019s why:', u'Financial stocks are responsible for much of the U.S. market\u2019s recent move, and the rally in financials is rooted in hopes for government deregulation of the industry. Financial stocks represent about a third of the S&amp;P and are up around 17% since the election. Take them out and there is no rally, Trump or otherwise. ', u'Except that interest rates aren\u2019t behind most of the rally. Instead, the enthusiasm for financials is more about prospects for repeal of the Dodd-Frank bank reform bill, as well as the Obama administration fiduciary rule that requires financial advisers, brokers, and asset managers to put clients\u2019 financial interests ahead of their own.

Clearly, asset managers aren\u2019t interest-rate plays, dispensing of the notion that rising rates are what\u2019s pumping the financials. ', u'Much of the rest of the rally is due to energy stocks. The money on oil now is a bet that recent OPEC production quotas will hold up. That bet has failed repeatedly \u2014 crude prices only keep up with inflation, since 1973, during brief fits of effective manipulation. Eventually, kleptocrats always choose stable home fronts over stable prices, and cheat on quotas to achieve it. They will again. Soon.

The changes, which PepsiCo plans to implement over the next eight months, include changes to the naming system to explicitly state the nature of the product -- such as ""fruit juice"" or ""fruit and veggie juice"" -- and what\'s inside of it, for example, ""kale flavored blend of 8 juices with other natural flavors,"" according to the agreement. Any imagery on the labels and descriptive statements will also reflect the product\'s most significant ingredients, and the claim ""no sugar added"" will be displayed less prominently, along with the disclaimer that the product is not a low-calorie food. The company also said it will not use ""unsubstantiated health-content or health-based claims"" in marketing or advertising of Naked juices. The settlement does not count as an admission of wrongdoing, PepsiCo and Naked Juice said. CSPI, which advocates for a healthier food system, commended PepsiCo on its cooperation and ""commitment to transparency."" ""Consumers deserve to know at a glance what they\'re buying, and Naked\'s labeling and marketing enhancements accomplish that,"" litigation director Maia Kats said. According to the agreement, the various labeling and marketing commitments expire in five years maximum, and could expire earlier depending on changes in the products or relevant regulations that would affect the entire agreement. PepsiCo agreed to remove the ""all natural"" claim from its Naked line in 2013 as part of a $9 million lawsuit settlement. PepsiCo shares were up a scant 1.0% in morning trade Tuesday.

Bearish investors have been out in full force, proclaiming, with high confidence, that it\u2019s time to sell stocks. At the same time, bullish gurus are saying just the opposite.   So who\u2019s right? ', u'Let\u2019s explore the answer. First, we need to develop some concepts through which we can find a sensible conclusion.   The middle road   For those who wish to know what The Arora Report is doing now, I will share with you an annotated chart that shows our actions since the election.   Please click here for the annotated chart.   The Arora Report\'s current call is to hold cash or Treasury bills (18%-28% of the portfolio) and short- to medium-term hedges (15%-25%) and very short-term hedges (15%) based on individual risk preference. (The numbers don\u2019t add up to 100% because of the mix of long exposure and hedging.)   The foregoing is derived from our adaptive ZYX Global Multi Asset Allocation Models that automatically changes itself with market conditions.   Bold promises, but can Trump deliver?   Trump has made bold promises. He has talked about achieving 4% growth in gross domestic product, massive deregulation and lower taxes for corporations. To figure out if the bulls or the bears are right, we need to know if Trump can deliver.   The bullish argument   Bullish gurus have put forward a variety of arguments. Most don\u2019t withstand rigorous analytical scrutiny, so I will not address them. Here\u2019s the main bullish argument that carries some weight.   Assuming Trump can deliver, the math is straightforward. The present consensus for earnings of the S&amp;P 500 Index                                                                                                                                                                                                           SPX, +0.23%                                                                                                                                                \xa0(often traded using the popular SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF                                                                                                                                                                                                           SPY, +0.28%                                                                                                                                                ), is $133. The Arora Report has analyzed Trump\'s proposals. His proposed tax cuts could add about $13 to S&amp;P 500 earnings. Deregulation could add another $7. If GDP were to start growing by 4% by the end of Trump\'s first term, S&amp;P 500 earnings may reach as high as $190.   Given the potential growth in the economy if Trump succeeds, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio may stay in the range of 18 to 21 in spite of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates. A P/E of 20 applied to $190 in earnings leads to 3,800 in S&amp;P 500.   That means Trump would generate a 67% return in the benchmark index. To some readers, such a projection may seem outrageous, but remember that under President Obama, the stock market returned 166%.', u' The bullish argument \u2014  part  two ', u' The bearish argument   Just like most of the bullish arguments, most of the bearish ones don\u2019t pass rigorous analytical scrutiny, so I won\u2019t address them either. Here\u2019s the main bearish argument that does carry some weight.   Assuming Trump\'s policies cause a deep recession, S&amp;P 500 earnings could shrink to $90. The P/E multiple could dwindle to 14. That would drop the S&amp;P 500 to 1,260, a stunning 44% decline. Bulls may think that\u2019s outlandish, but in the recession of 2008, the market fell by about one-half.   How to determine which scenario is right   As an American, I wholeheartedly wish Trump success. I also know that my fellow Americans, including those vigorously opposed to him, would rather see the new president succeed than fail for the good of the country (and the world).   Wishing, however, is not a good investment strategy. We simply need to determine the probability of Trump\'s success. Notice that I used the word \u201cprobability.\u201d My longtime readers already know what has come to be known as Nigam\'s Second Law of Investing: \u201cNo one knows with certainty what is going to happen next.\u201d Yes, that includes me. In the absence of certainty, the best way to \u201cknow\u201d is to invest based on probability.   Trump is promising major change. \u201cThere is nothing more difficult to carry out, nor more doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to handle, than to initiate a new order of things,"" said Niccolo Machiavelli, the Italian Renaissance philosopher. Based on my own experiences of creating change through two Inc. 500 fastest-growing companies that I founded and more than 50 ventures, I am so convinced that Machiavelli was right that his words are the opening words in my book, \u201cTheory ZYX of Successful Change Management: A Definitive Guide to Reach the Next Level.\u201d The changes I created were infinitely smaller than what Trump is trying to do.   As Trump proceeds, he is going to discover the truth that all change agents ultimately face: Those who are benefiting from the status quo will fight that change tooth and nail. Since the change has not yet happened, there are not many who have actually benefited from the change, even though they hope to. But their fervor often does not match the determination of those who want to hold on to the status quo.   My whole investing success is based on change. I follow the ZYX Change Method that consists of six screens. One of the screens is designed to judge if a change will be successful \u2014 before Wall Street finds out.   When I apply this screen to understand the probability of 4% GDP growth and the probability of a deep recession, the odds of the former are somewhat higher; still, there is simply not enough margin between the two odds to know which scenario is likely to come true.', u'Will Trump succeed? In plain English, the answer is not knowable with any reasonable confidence at this time. In my analysis, the confidence displayed by both bulls and bears is wrong.

That\u2019s one possible reason filing could be off to a slow start. ', u'It\u2019s also possible that because of comments President Donald Trump made during his campaign and as recently as this week about tax reform, some filers are waiting to see if anything will change before they file.', u'For example, Trump has advocated for lower tax rates for most of the top tax brackets, so some higher-income individuals may be hoping they would get that benefit this year by waiting to book certain income. ', u'Tax changes could happen shortly into Trump\u2019s presidency. But any such changes Trump makes in 2017 would impact 2017 taxes at the earliest, said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of social and economic policy group Urban Institute and research group Brookings Institution based in Washington, D.C. ', u' See also: This chart shows how Republicans and Democrats feel about their money right now ', u'General uncertainty about taxes and other topics in the tense political climate may also contribute to some filers\u2019 anxiety, and as a result, cause them to file later, said Linda Hagen, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Southern California\u2019s Marshall School of Business. Studies have shown a link between procrastination and anxiety \u2014 something sometimes confused with laziness. \u201cI would not be surprised if people worry about taxes and money a lot more at the moment and feel a greater sense of uncertainty around it because there is a good chance things are going to change,\u201d she said.', u'However, a more likely reason for the delay is a law enacted in late December 2015, which is impacting 2016 taxes, Gleckman said. It mandates that the IRS cannot issue a refund on tax returns claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit or Additional Child Tax Credit until Feb. 15. If those filing are aware of that law, it may be a reason they waited, he said.', u'What\u2019s more, knowing one\u2019s refund will be lower could be another factor that adds to procrastination: People who expect to receive higher refunds tend to file their returns earlier than those who expect smaller refunds, a 2015 survey of about 1,000 tax filers by Georgetown University\u2019s Institute for Consumer Research found. Similarly, people who expect to owe a smaller amount of money file earlier than those expecting to pay larger amounts. ', u' How to convince yourself to file earlier ', u'The more time you have to file, the less stressful (in theory) it should be. There is plenty of time remaining to file, which could offset initial trends in the remaining weeks until the deadline. The amount of receipts that are self-prepared and filed electronically actually seems to be growing, as do visits to IRS.gov, according to IRS data.

For some, it may be thinking about a specific splurge they\u2019d like to buy with their refund, or debt they\u2019d like to wipe out, she said. For others, it may be a reward that reinforces their positive feelings about taking control of their lives and acting responsibly, such as buying items for their home office. Financial experts recommend saving money from tax returns instead of spending frivolously, but for those with larger tax returns, it may be possible to save and still buy a reasonably-priced treat as a reward.

GE has increased the number of employees at the company to 244 from 200 and is expected to reach 350 to 400 people by early 2018. Most of the new hires will be in engineering and technicians, GE said in a statement. GE is planning a big expansion of the company\'s headquarters in Lichtenfels with new space planned for manufacturing, product development, testing and administration. The company also has operations in the U.S., in Grapevine, Texas, and in China. GE has been on a buying spree of 3-D metal printing companies of late. In 2016, it acquired Sweden\'s Arcam AB and Germany\'s SLM Solutions Group AG for a combined $1.4 billion. Those moves were aimed at pushing the company into 3-D printing as a way to make aircraft components and other parts. 3-D printing involves using digital designs and modeling software with laser technology to create parts that are usually lighter and more durable than traditionally manufactured parts because they need less welding and machining. But much of the promise of the market is the extra design possibilities for engineers. GE shares were flat Wednesday, and are down 5.5% in the year so far.

So any sign of a repeat has them selling. ', u' U.S. producers: They\u2019re baack! ', u'Thanks to higher energy prices, U.S. shale producers are back. They\u2019re deploying a lot more rigs. The rig count is back up over 600 compared with a low of 316 in May 2016 \u2014 and they are fracking a lot more. This also brings back bad memories of hefty losses for energy investors.

Davis replaced Speese nearly three years ago, but the rental-furnishings chain struggled last year thanks to a large impairment charge and sales declines that Davis blamed on a new point-of-sale system. ""I am extremely proud of what our team has accomplished in the past three years, during a dynamic and challenging environment,"" Davis said in the news release announcing the change. Speese, who had been serving as chairman of Rent-A-Center\'s board, previously served as CEO from 2001 to 2014. Rent-A-Center shares, which had fallen 21.8% in the past year, were steady in late trading Monday afternoon.']","['u', 'Rent', 'A', 'Center', 'Inc', 'RCII', 'announced', 'late', 'Monday', 'afternoon', 'Chief', 'Executive', 'Robert', 'Davis', 'resigned', 'replaced', 'interim', 'basis', 'founder', 'CEO', 'Mark', 'Speese', 'Davis', 'replaced', 'Speese']",0.0

Nothing can go on like that forever.\u201d In Linehan\u2019s view, passive portfolios will reach a breaking point when valuations become too skewed relative to those in active portfolios, and fund flows are no longer pushing the indexes to outperform. \u201cWhen people are piling into a trade, it can pay to take the other side,\u201d he says. That happened just after the dot-com stock bubble, which is one of the periods when even average active managers beat the benchmarks. Another such period occurred around the market top in 2007.', u'The stock market doesn\u2019t have to tumble for good active managers to earn their fees now, however.

The yearly epistle is eagerly read by an audience much wider than Berkshire investors for insights into the mind-set of the legendary investor and world\u2019s third richest person.', u'Buffett tipped his hand in a December interview with Fortune. While he has made his world-beating fortune picking stocks, he\u2019s virtually evangelical on the allure of the passive, follow-the-market approach for the bulk of investors.', u'Passive investing \u201cwill beat active over time,\u201d he told the magazine. \u201cBut not for the manager. The manager\u2019s going to make money out of active, and the investor\u2019s going to do better with passive. I\u2019m writing a lot about this subject in next year\u2019s annual report. I really am. A lot.\u201d', u' See: This little-noticed phenomenon could make stock picking great again ', u' Also read: Wall Street pushes active management, but investors aren\u2019t biting ', u'On that note, Buffett looks all but certain to win a wager he made in 2007 betting that index funds could outperform hedge funds.

The bet ends Dec. 31, and it would take a massive market drop for Buffett to lose, as the Wall Street Journal noted this week. ', u'But, as MarketWatch\u2019s Francine McKenna noted this week, Berkshire has also used alternative financial metrics over the past three years that are considered to be non-GAAP\u2014instances that Buffett defended in last year\u2019s letter.

Some 27% of that money will go on a party or a bar. If New Year\u2019s Day is the Super Bowl for hangover cures, as described by Brenna Haysom, president of Rally Labs, which makes \u201cBlowfish for Hangovers,\u201d then St. Patrick\u2019s Day is March Madness, particularly as most of the time green-clad revellers have to work the next day.', u'Over-the-counter antacids to relieve stomach upsets alone are estimated to reach $810 million in 2021, versus $714 million three years ago, according to Euromonitor. They include products like Alka-Seltzer Gummies and ones specifically marketed for the purpose like Blowfish for Hangovers ($12 for 12 tablets). Herbal and dietary supplements \u2014 including hangover treatments like PartySmart and Drinkin\u2019 Mate \u2014 are projected to hit $2.1 billion in 2021, up from $1.6 billion in 2013. And adult pain relievers \u2014 over-the-counter medicines like aspirin, ibuprofen (including Advil) and acetaminophen (Tylenol) \u2014 will hit $4.1 billion in 2021, up from $3.8 billion in 2013. ', u'Perhaps the most expensive and desperate hangover cures are intravenous drips, typically used successfully to rehydrate people with influenza in hospitals to restore nutrients and fluids, but they\u2019re not covered by health insurance for hangovers. There clinics include Reviv Wellness Spa in Miami, IVme in Chicago and Hangover Heaven in Las Vegas, which rehydrate people intravenously. (The latter has received mostly positive reviews on Yelp.) Although IVme also treats athletes, the clinic has a hangover IV of saline, vitamins and an anti-inflammatory pain medicine, anti-nausea and anti-reflux medications for $129 (or $149 for another IV with oxygen).

(Please click here for the annotated chart.) The posture that The Arora Report has taken is to trade the stock but not invest in it at this time. We have \u201cjust in case\u201d defensive stops in place and are taking profits on half of the position and continuing to hold the remainder for a little longer to see if momentum drives the stock higher.', u' Comparison to GoPro ', u'GoPro at its core is a hardware company that markets itself as a content company. Its IPO was hotter than Snap\u2019s. The stock shot up several fold in price and then crashed, and it now trades for under $10. Just like GoPro, Snap is marketing itself as a video-camera company, but it is different in that, at its core, it\u2019s an advertising company. When GoPro came public, I did not hesitate to slap a $10 target on it at a time when the stock was popular and soaring. You can see my reasoning here. ', u' Comparison to Facebook ', u'Snap, as I said, is an advertising company \u2014 just like Facebook and Alphabet                                                                                                                                                                                                           GOOG, +0.16%                                                                                                                                                \xa0Bulls contend that Snap can succeed just like Facebook. However, investors must note a big difference: Facebook had a wider appeal from the beginning, whereas Snap so far has appealed to a limited demographic of younger people. ', u'At The Arora Report, we bought the Facebook IPO, took profits on the very first day and exited the trade. We bought it again at $49.92, have stayed steadfastly bullish on it, and still hold it. Please see \u201cMarket correction suggests Facebook may be the next Apple\u201d and \u201cFacebook ad prices double; will the stock also?\u201d ', u' Comparison to Twitter ', u'Please see \u201cBack up the truck and buy the Twitter IPO\u201d and \u201cWhy, and how, you should trade the Twitter IPO.\u201d', u' My take on Snap ', u'My long-time readers know well that my core principle is to be brutally honest with investors. I often tell investors what they do not want to hear. I follow the ZYX Change Method to analyze stocks. According to the ZYX Change Method, the uncertainty surrounding Snap at this time is so great that the stock is simply not analyzable as an investment with a high degree of confidence for the long run. The stock can easily go down to $10 or shoot up to $100.

As a matter of fact, it\u2019s up more than 1,500% since I first bought it on the day it became public. Android is still probably the single biggest driver of this stock right now. Interestingly, Amazon\u2019s Alexa voice-activated artificial intelligent platform is a big threat to Android \u2014 an even bigger threat for Google\u2019s Android operating system than it is for Apple\u2019s iPhone/Siri. The reason is that Apple makes the hardware and Android, as a software platform, gets less relevant as Alexa becomes more dominant.']",[],0.0

The GOP\u2019s bill, as expected, begins the task of replacing the health insurance more than 20 million Americans rely upon by repealing taxes that pay for it, nearly all paid by families with incomes over $250,000 and by corporations. (Which has been the point of this exercise all along.) It phases out Obamacare\u2019s expansion of Medicaid eligibility into the working class, stranding 15 million folks who mostly work for companies that don\u2019t offer affordable insurance.', u'Predictably, moderates and liberals think the bill is too chary toward poor and middle-class people \u2014 including four Senate Republicans whose opposition to its Medicaid-expansion phaseout means it won\u2019t pass the Senate without major changes.

Because one thing\u2019s exactly like the other.', u' First, no matter how often Ryan calls ACA a job-killer, it ain\u2019t. The current streak of 84 months of positive job creation, by far the record, began in February 2010, the month President Barack Obama signed the ACA. Private employers who were supposed to be scared into submission have created 16 million jobs since, including nearly 6 million at small businesses supposedly frozen into not investing by the prospect of skyrocketing medical costs.', u' Second, the tax on medical-device companies simply didn\u2019t hurt them.', u'Device companies like Medtronic                                                                                                                                                                                                           MDT, -0.34%                                                                                                                                                \xa0began caterwauling even before the ACA was approved \u2014 a 2.3% excise tax on medical devices helped pay for the plan. Their point was that everybody got something in exchange for supporting the law but them: Hospitals got fewer uninsured patients and more volume, insurers got new customers with subsidized premiums and so on. Device makers, on the other hand, thought they wouldn\u2019t be able to pass the tax along and would have to eat it, in the form of narrower profit margins and languishing stocks.', u'Uh, no.

In particular, insurers had been caught unprepared for a spike in prescription-drug costs, led by new remedies for hepatitis C that cost nearly $100,000 per patient. \u201cPeople seeking care through these \u2026 products need this care,\u201d Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini said. \u201c[They] aren\u2019t running off to get services that they don\u2019t need.\u201d', u'Insurers had a simple answer for that: Rule changes that cut drug costs, plus mergers that let them make up unexpectedly high medical expenses on some ACA patients by cutting administrative costs.

Four of the Big Five insurance companies have seen their shares triple since 2012, and the laggard, Aetna, more than doubled.', u'As the venture capitalist Ann Lamont and former Obama aide Ezekiel Emanuel point out, business writ broadly has saved a ton of money under the ACA, because it dramatically slowed increases in health-care costs.

Editas has an exclusive license to medical breakthroughs stemming from the use of patents awarded to co-founder Feng Zhang of the Broad Institute for CRISPR, a gene-editing technique. The Broad, which is affiliated with Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has been in a dispute with University of California at Berkeley on those patents. Cal scientists developed the technology behind CRISPR, and the Broad showed how it could be used to edit genes in specific species, leading to a dispute over who could claim ownership. Stat News and others reported Wednesday that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office had ruled in the Broad\'s favor, though the USPTO told MarketWatch that the decision would not be made public until Thursday.

""Please know we sought FDA approval of Emflaza to improve access to this treatment,"" Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Aronin said. ""We have and always will support you in that endeavor."" He did not say when the drug would be launched, or whether the company would change its price. Under 1,000 patients who receive the drug for free through Marathon\'s expanded access program will continue to do so, Marathon said.

So any sign of a repeat has them selling. ', u' U.S. producers: They\u2019re baack! ', u'Thanks to higher energy prices, U.S. shale producers are back. They\u2019re deploying a lot more rigs. The rig count is back up over 600 compared with a low of 316 in May 2016 \u2014 and they are fracking a lot more. This also brings back bad memories of hefty losses for energy investors.

HPE is in the process of two more financially driven spin-outs \u2014 computer services and software \u2014 that will likely lead to yet more restructuring costs.', u'Investors were clearly unsettled by the predicted shortfall and by what executives referred to as \u201cexecution issues.\u201d HPE shares tumbled more than 6% in after-hours trading, adding to recent struggles.

', u'Whitman and her executive team gave a string of reasons for the latest earnings mess, which included a slashed annual forecast: an order shortfall from a large, unidentified \u201ctier 1 service provider\u201d; expensive and hard-to-get memory components; and currency fluctuations. But those excuses are not good enough.', u'It appears that HPE\u2019s hybrid cloud strategy may also not be enough to keep all its customers from moving to vendors offering cloud computing for less. Whitman has shown a willingness to make deals that seem more disciplined than past disasters like Autonomy, such as recent acquisitions for SimpliVity and Cloud Corridor in key growth areas. But for HPE to show any real revenue growth now, some of those deals are going to have to start showing up in the company\u2019s top line. ', u'Whitman has yet to deliver on her promise that the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise would be more agile and better off on its own. As year two begins as a solo company, with excuses running out and restructuring seeming to never end, time is not on her side to show better results.

If the intent of the wall is to cut off the flow of undocumented immigrants into the U.S. from Mexico, its builders should take into account that more Mexican migrants have been leaving the United States than entering it since 2009. The number of undocumented Mexican immigrants has declined by 1.3 million since 2007, though it\u2019s worth noting that the number of migrants from Central America who\u2019ve cleared fences at both Mexico\u2019s southern and northern borders has risen during that time.', u'That said, the number of total undocumented immigrants has declined since 2009 \u2014 and has dropped drastically in states including California, Nevada and Illinois.

7298,TAP,Molson Coors Brewing  Company,"7 : [u'\r\n        ', u' How craft beer lost its craft and gained layoffs\r\n    ']","[u'Jan 18, 2017 12:38 p.m. ET']","[u'After we ran an interview with Pabst Brewing Co. owner Eugene Kashper, I began thinking about the Brewers Association\u2019s definition of a craft brewer as it applies to Pabst. There are many reasons to consider Pabst outside the \u201ccraft\u201d beer realm: Its Schlitz brand was once bigger than Anheuser-Busch InBev SA                                                                                                                                                                                                           BUD, -0.57%                                                                                                                                                 its portfolio is heavy with light lager, it now partners with multiple international brands including Mexico\u2019s Minerva and China\u2019s Tsingtao, and it has a strong business in decidedly non-craft flavored malt beverages (FMB) such as Not Your Father\u2019s Root Beer.', u'But various changes to the BA\u2019s definition have not only made Pabst\u2019s status an arguable point, but they\u2019ve also diluted the essence of the term \u201ccraft beer.\u201d The definition has three pillars: \u201csmall,\u201d \u201cindependent\u201d and \u201ctraditional.\u201d While Pabst would never have fit under the Brewers Association\u2019s original limit for \u201csmall\u201d \u2014 2 million barrels of annual production \u2014 the 5.5 million barrels it produced in 2015 fell below the 6-million-barrel mark the BA set when it changed its barrel production limit in 2010 to accommodate the growth of Boston Beer Co.                                                                                                                                                                                                           SAM, +0.40%                                                                                                                                                \xa0and its Samuel Adams brand.', u'Pabst would also have been easily excluded for producing mostly lager brewed with adjuncts such as corn or rice. However, the Brewers Association changed the \u201ctraditional\u201d portion of its definition in 2015 to include pre-Prohibition brewers, such as D.G. Yuengling and Sons, and August Schell, which have consistently brewed with maize (an ingredient once considered non-traditional by BA). That leaves the \u201cindependent\u201d portion, which states that less than 25% of a brewery can be \u201cowned or controlled (or equivalent economic interest) by an alcohol industry member that is not itself a craft brewer.\u201d Pabst is owned by Kashper and the private-equity firm TSG Consumer Partners, and ownership by private-equity firms has been generally accepted by the Brewers Association.', u'So why isn\u2019t Pabst \u201ccraft\u201d by this definition? Brewers Association spokesman Paul Gatza notes that the barrels of production Pabst sends to other countries, including China, now puts its production above 6 million. Meanwhile, Brewers Association economist Bart Watson notes that beer brewed under contract by other facilities is or isn\u2019t \u201ccraft,\u201d based on the facility brewing it. Since a large portion of Pabst beers are brewed at Molson Coors Brewing Co.\u2019s                                                                                                                                                                                                           TAP, +0.02%                                                                                                                                                 MillerCoors facilities \u2014 and MillerCoors isn\u2019t considered \u201ccraft\u201d \u2014 Pabst doesn\u2019t receive the \u201ccraft\u201d designation.', u'Those are some of the lesser consequences of such ambitious capital development. Green Flash Brewing of San Diego opened its Virginia Beach brewery last year, but not before influential brewmaster Chuck Silva left the company to found his own California brewery. Just this month, Green Flash laid off a number of employees in the wake of that expansion. In nearby Escondido, Calif., Stone Brewing Co. ended a year in which it opened new breweries in Richmond, Va., and Berlin \u2014 while losing longtime brewmaster Mitch Steele \u2014 by laying off dozens of employees. ', u'Before the Brewers Association\u2019s definition of a craft brewer and before small brewers even called their product \u201ccraft beer,\u201d the \u201ccraft\u201d portion of that moniker was short for hand-crafted. It implied that the hands producing and selling that beer mattered as much as the beer itself. That small, nimble, creative model is lean by nature and distinguishes itself by making beer and creating beer-based experiences that larger brewers can\u2019t.', u'A-B InBev has since purchased eight other U.S. craft breweries similarly focused on growth. MillerCoors, meanwhile, found willing partners in Saint Archer of San Diego, Oregon\u2019s Hop Valley and Georgia\u2019s Terrapin. Petaluma, Calif.-based Lagunitas and its owner, longtime craft firebrand Tony Magee, sold a half share to Heineken NV                                                                                                                                                                                                           HEINY, -0.23%                                                                                                                                                 for $500 million and has since begun expanding Lagunitas\u2019 presence and buying other breweries. Meanwhile, Ballast Point of San Diego last year announced plans to build an East Coast brewery near Roanoke,Va., but only after being purchased by Constellation Brands Inc.

So any sign of a repeat has them selling. ', u' U.S. producers: They\u2019re baack! ', u'Thanks to higher energy prices, U.S. shale producers are back. They\u2019re deploying a lot more rigs. The rig count is back up over 600 compared with a low of 316 in May 2016 \u2014 and they are fracking a lot more. This also brings back bad memories of hefty losses for energy investors.

Roche said for post-surgical treatment, its Perjeta drug in combination with chemotherapy drug Herceptin and chemotherapy was able to reduce risk of recurrence in a statistically significant way relative to just Herceptin and chemotherapy. This result, assuming no surprises from the data in full, has essentially ""eliminated"" the commercial opportunity in post-surgical treatment for Puma\'s neratinib drug, which is also being developed for breast cancer, according to RBC Capital Markets analyst Simos Simeonidis. ""With Perjeta soon to be on the market, marketed by Roche\'s dominant marketing machine that has owned the HER2+ space for a decade, we believe this active yet difficult to administer agent would have a very tough time being commercially relevant, even if it ended up being approved,"" he said, lowering his price target by 55% to $17.

The doll maker already makes a male infant doll as part of its Bitty Baby line, but never had a boy version of the 18-inch dolls that the company is best known for. ', u'The introduction of the toy this week had many fans cheering, and a Mattel spokeswoman told the New York Times that customers had been asking for one for years \u2014 not just for their sons but for their daughters as well. ', u'The toy market has been lacking boy dolls for decades despite demand, sparking creativity among crafty moms and doll-making startups alike. Gina DeMillo Wagner, a writer and photographer, wrote on her blog that when her then-6-year-old son wanted a male American Girl doll, she made her own by cutting a doll\u2019s hair, removing its makeup with acetone and finding boy doll clothes on Etsy. She gives most of the credit to boy doll manufacturing to startups like Boy Story and Wonder Crew, two companies that proved before Mattel jumped on board that there was a demand for boy dolls, she said. ', u'Doll play is beneficial for girls and boys, because it stimulates developmental skills, including care giving and nurturing, Hains said. As more dads take on care-giving roles, and some stay at home full time, boys can imitate their actions through playing with their dolls. Having dolls that look like them also allows them to connect with the toys, rather than action figures of characters who are older and have \u201crestrictive\u201d body images, such as the stereotypical muscular superhero, she said. ', u'But not everyone agrees boy dolls are necessary, and in some circles boys may be discouraged from playing with such toys, experts said. This isn\u2019t always best for the child, though. Toys attached to strong gender stereotypes were less developmentally beneficial for children, and could focus the children\u2019s attention to traits parents may not want for them, such as prioritizing attractiveness for girls or emphasizing violence for boys, Judith Elaine Blakemore, a professor of psychology and associate dean of arts and sciences for faculty development at Indiana University\u2013Purdue University, told the National Association for the Education of Young Children, a membership organization for children\u2019s learning.

The social media stock slid to $22.11 a share in morning trade, after closing down more than 12% on Monday. Last week, the stock priced at $17 a share. The declines follow a wave of bearish analyst notes that have hit Snap, which calls itself a camera company, since its market debut. The average rating on the stock is the equivalent to sell, while the average price target is $16.50, according to a FactSet survey of 8 analysts. Many of the analysts have been warning clients that Snap stock is overvalued. Others have cited the company\'s shaky fundamentals, with its widening losses and slowing user growth offsetting strong revenue gains.
