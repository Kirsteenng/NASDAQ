    Jefferies says these stocks should beat the market if inflation increases","	  Friday,  3 Feb 2017 | 10:19  AM ET","Investors worried about rising inflation should buy stocks with steady costs, making them less vulnerable to swings in prices, Jefferies told clients on Thursday.    ""We continue to recommend owning companies with high fixed costs over rising variable costs. Equally with valuations already discounting a significant recovery, investors should remain wary of expensive stocks,"" Sean Darby, chief global equity strategist, wrote in a research note.     Darby says a strong U.S. dollar is the ""main headwind"" for corporate earnings, as seen in a decline in foreign revenues among multinationals, while a rise in input costs, such as wages and raw materials, could further impact margins.     ""The bottom line is that while a value strategy will work in the U.S., investors should keep an eye on margins and the degree of operating leverage or asset turns stocks offer. Inflation ought to mean higher and faster pricing power but it will mean a jump in costs,"" he said.  The following equities made Darby's list of cheap stocks with stable costs.",[],0.0

MMP,Magellan Midstream Partners L.P.,4:Cramer’s roadmap to finding stocks that will thrive in a new political world,"Friday, 20 Jan 2017 |  6:52  PM ET","  Now that Donald Trump has officially been sworn in as president, Jim Cramer will be using a new metric to evaluate companies.    It all comes down to whether a stock is or isn't a Trump stock. Cramer expects Trump's agenda of deregulation, lower corporate taxes and repatriation of foreign assets to have a significant impact on the economy and stock market.    On the flipside, when Trump has a problem with a company, he's not afraid to Tweet what is on his mind—something that will put certain industries under fire.    ""You will feel a whole lot more comfortable owning the Trump stocks than the non-Trump variety,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.   The stocks that will benefit the most from Trump's legislative agenda are those that will benefit enormously from deregulation, such as banks and energy stocks.    The Obama administration was focused on fighting climate change, which was good for the environment but bad for the fossil fuel business. Trump's position is the polar opposite.  More importantly, Cramer said the former real estate mogul will have the most pro-petroleum cabinet in history.    ""If the oil the gas industry had a wish list for what their ideal government would look like, you are looking at it,"" Cramer said.    Cramer's top picks were the pipeline plays, since they can make money even if the price of crude keeps falling, like Magellan Midstream and oil service company Schlumberger.    Banks will also benefit from deregulation. Cramer also believes that the President's agenda will jump start the economy and the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates, with banks being the chief beneficiary. Cramer's top picks were Bank of America, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs.    Anything that is directly connected to stronger employment will do well, too, given that Trump has given job creation his top priority. That means payroll processors like Paychex and ADP will do well and Cintas, because more hiring means more uniforms.    Companies with large amounts of cash overseas are potential Trump stocks, like Apple. Infrastructure and defense contractors were on Cramer's list as well.    As for stocks that Cramer thinks will struggle under Trump, the pharmaceutical industry could be under Trump's tweeting microscope. He has said repeatedly that he wants to roll back many of the recent drug price increases. A possible repeal of Obamacare without a replacement could hurt healthcare and drug stocks.    Investors should also worry about any American company that makes things overseas and then exports them back to the U.S.    ""Put it all together, though, and there is a lot more Trump stocks than there are non-Trump stocks,"" Cramer said.

Michael Kors — The luxury goods maker beat estimates by a penny a share, with quarterly profit of $1.64 per share. The company's revenue was below estimates, and its full-year sales and earnings guidance came in below forecasts as well. 21st Century Fox — The media company reported adjusted quarterly profit of 53 cents per share, 4 cents a share above estimates. Revenue was just slightly below Street forecasts. Profit was up 27 percent over a year earlier, as ad sales and affiliate fees increased. Gap — Gap posted a January comparable-store sales increase of 1 percent, slightly below estimates, but the apparel retailer did give a full-year earnings outlook that exceeds Wall Street forecasts. The parent of Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy saw stronger-than-expected sales during the holiday quarter. Centene — The health insurer reported adjusted quarterly profit of $1.19 per share, beating estimates of $1.11 a share. Revenue also beat forecasts, with results being helped by more members and the acquisition of Health Net. Mallinckrodt — The drugmaker came in 9 cents a share above estimates, with quarterly profit of $1.91 per share. Revenue was above consensus as well. The company's bottom line was boosted by strong results in its specialty brands segment. Mosaic — The fertilizer producer beat estimates by 13 cents a share, with adjusted quarterly profit of 26 cents per share. Mosaic also cut its annual dividend to 60 cents per share from $1.10, however, with the company trying to maintain a strong balance sheet as its market recovers. Teva Pharmaceutical — Teva appointed Chairman Yitzhak Peterburg as interim chief executive officer, following the departure of Erez Vigodman as CEO. Board member Sol Barer will take over for Peterburg as chairman. Vigodman's departure comes after just 18 months on the job for the world's largest generic drug maker.

Cardinal Health — The drug distributor reported adjusted quarterly profit of $1.34 per share, beating estimates of $1.23, though revenue was slightly short of forecasts due to generic pricing and the loss of a large distribution customer.

FOSL,"Fossil Group, Inc.",2:Shares of Fossil tumble 20 percent as wearables aren't all they're cracked up to be,"Wednesday, 15 Feb 2017 |  9:55  AM ET","Shares of Fossil tumbled nearly 20 percent in early trading Wednesday, after the watchmaker missed Wall Street's fourth-quarter sales and profit expectations and provided a soft outlook for its 2017 fiscal year. The company's stock was last trading at $18.57. ""Fossil's fourth-quarter print was in and of itself, 'not much worse than feared'; however the implications on the go-forward operations leave us with a growing list of concerns on a business that is caught in the crosshairs of an evolving category amid shifting consumerpreferences,"" Wells Fargo analyst Ike Boruchow, who downgraded the company's shares to ""underperform"" from ""market perform,"" told investors. Those concerns include the company's top line miss, which came despite its ""much-hyped"" push into wearable technology. Fossil had to lower prices on these products to get consumers to bite, and plans relaunch the category in the third quarter with lower prices. That will eat into the category's profitability, Boruchow warned. Fossil's investments in wearable technology have also sent its debt levels and interest expense higher. ""It will be critical that the second-half sales acceleration implied by [Fossil's] guidance materializes to keep the company in the black,"" Evercore ISI analyst Omar Saad said. Yet despite investors' skittishness, Fossil CEO Kosta Kartsotis remains optimistic about the category. ""Even with overall fourth-quarter sales at the low end of our expectations, we began to observe new emerging trends to support our thesis that wearable technology can be the catalyst to drive growth in the watch category,"" he told analysts on a conference call Tuesday. During the fourth quarter, Fossil earned $1.03 a share on $959 million in revenue. Wall Street had been expecting the company to report earnings of $1.18 a share on $977 million in sales. On an adjusted basis, Fossil expects to earn between $1 and$1.70 per share in fiscal 2017, down from $1.80 adjusted last year.

TGT,Target Corporation,9:Target CEO says retailer making $7 billion investment to 'win share not surrender it',"Tuesday, 28 Feb 2017 | 12:27  PM ET","Target will pour $7 billion in capital into areas including its digital properties, its new and existing store base, and lower prices over the next three years, as it tries to adapt to consumers' changing shopping habits and turn around a sales slump that continued into the fiscal fourth quarter. These investments will also take $1 billion out of the company's operating margin annually, but will better position the retailer for the long term, CEO Brian Cornell told analysts at an event in New York City on Tuesday.Investors balked at the news, sending the company's shares 12 percent lower in midday trading. Target stock was on pace to record its biggest daily sell-off since 1998, with shares last trading hands at $58.35.""Many of our competitors are aggressively rationalizing their assets. They're cutting costs just to keep their heads above water,"" Cornell said. ""This contraction will create opportunities for Target to pick up market share over the long term.""In fiscal 2017, roughly $500 million of Target's operating profit investment will be allocated toward driving growth in its business. That includes upgrading more than 100 of its big-box stores; roughly doubling the number of small-format shops it has in college towns and urban areas; adding new brands to its portfolio; and investing in faster, more profitable delivery of online orders.Another $400 million will be spent onlowering prices across the store, with an emphasis on staples like food and other household essentials. The retailer said it will lean on its historical reputation as a place where prices are low every day, instead of relying on promotions as it's recently done. That decision mimics a recent move by Wal-Mart, which has been gaining share in part by slashing prices.As a result of these initiatives, Target expects fiscal 2017 and 2018 to be investment years. It should return to stability and growth in 2019, Cornell said.""We're asking shareholders to make a meaningful investment,"" Cornell said. ""We're investing to win share not surrender it."" While Macy's and J.C. Penney plan to close roughly 100 stores each this year, Target will stick to its historical strategy of closing roughly a dozen locations. To revitalize traffic and sales in its remaining established stores, which recorded their third straight quarterly sales decline in the holiday period, Target will improve their appearance and visual merchandising.These updates will allow the retailer to better show customers how they can tie together an outfit, and will include more space for order pickup. The company expects its remodels, which were influenced by the results of its tests in L.A., to lift sales by 2 to 4 percent in each store.By 2019, the retailer expects to have refurbished some 600 of its stores.""They're old, they're tired and they haven't been updated in years,"" Cornell said. ""Each store's going to look and feel like a totally new Target.""The CEO reiterated that having a massive fleet is a key competitive advantage for Target, with CFO Cathy Smith adding that its stores ""universally"" generate cash.Meanwhile, Target will open roughly 30 small-format stores this year, and add a total of 100 over the next three years. These shops allow Target to enter more dense markets, and also serve as fulfillment centers. Even with their higher operating costs, they deliver two times the sales productivity of an average Target store, Cornell said.Aside from its investments in stores, Target plans to continue pouring money into its supply chain so that it can deliver online orders more quickly and profitably. Though the retailer's 34 percent increase in online sales lifted its top line in the fiscal fourth quarter, it dented its margins.The chain is also looking to capitalize on the popularity of its Cat &amp; Jack children's brand by rolling out even more exclusive lines. The retailer plans to launch more than 12 new brands, representing more than $10 billion in sales, over the next two years. Perhaps the most controversial piece of Target's plan is its decision to lower prices at the expense of gross margin. The retailer has struggled over the years to find the right balance between value and style, as competitor Wal-Mart has been taking down prices. Yet while value is important to the Target consumer, winning a price war against Wal-Mart is a tough proposition. Its massive scale and relationships with vendors have made it hard for other retailers to compete.""Part of [Target's strategy] is a sensible recognition of heightened price activity in the market,"" Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, told investors. ""However, we would also caution that Target should not chase Wal-Mart on price, as it is a battle that cannot easily be won.""""We also believe that many of Target's issues are not solely price related,"" Saunders added.Indeed, while Target touched on the changes it's made to its grocery division — namely, bringing in more local products, shipping produce more frequently and upping its focus on adult beverages — Cornell admitted that it still has more work to do in that department.Food accounts for roughly 20 percent of Target's sales, and is often used in retail a means to drive repeat traffic from shoppers. However, Cornell reiterated on Tuesday that it is not a full-service grocer, and will continue to utilize its food department as a way to get shoppers to add extra items to their baskets.""We're embracing who we are,"" Cornell said.Target outlined its strategy for growth after reporting fiscal fourth-quarter sales and earnings that disappointed investors. The company's outlook for fiscal 2017 also came well short of analysts' expectations due to its aggressive investment plan.","[Target, pour, capital, area, including, digital, property, existing, store, base, price, year, try, adapt, consumer, changing, shopping, habit, turn, slump, term, CEO, Brian, Cornell, told, analyst, event, New, York, City, Tuesday, Investors, balked, news, sending, company, share, percent, midday, trading, Target, record, biggest, share, trading, hand, Many, competitor, aggressively, rationalizing, asset, They, cutting, cost, keep, head, water, Cornell, said, This, share, trading, hand, Many, competitor, aggressively, rationalizing, asset, They, cutting, cost, keep, head, water, Cornell, said, This, contraction, create, opportunity, Target, pick, market, share, term, In, fiscal, roughly, Target, operating, profit, investment, allocated, driving, growth, business, That, includes, upgrading, big, ...]",1.0

Penney CEO: The only one taking Amazon seriously is Walmart,"Thursday, 23 Feb 2017 |  7:08  PM ET","In the retail world, many are trying to stand out against Amazon, but former J.C. Penney CEO and former head of retail for Apple Ron Johnson says only one retailer is truly making an effort. ""The only retailer that's truly taking Amazon seriously is Walmart,"" Johnson told CNBC's ""Fast Money"" on Thursday. ""Walmart generates five times the net income that Amazon does. Walmart has the resources to take them on."" However, Johnson pointed out that Walmart will still need to figure out how to compete better to counteract Amazon's skyrocketing growth.  ""They're making a lot of moves and it's starting to pay off, but even Walmart will have trouble because if Walmart doubles its $10 billion in sales, it will add $10 billion while Amazon adds $80 billion. People have to take Amazon much more seriously,"" Johnson said.  For retail in general, Johnson suggested that companies should band together in order to make a real impact in taking on the e-commerce giant.  ""If you look at it, collectively, they can have impact. When the industry goes together and Simon [Malls] puts together a better center, people come,"" Johnson said. ""The super regional mall is doing well against Amazon. It's very hard for an individual store within its four walls to create an experience that can matter enough."" Johnson also suggested a few questions retailers should be asking themselves if they take on the mission to beat Amazon. ""What do you do in store to beat Amazon? What do we do with our merchandise to make sure it's differentiated and preferred? How do we price goods?"" Johnson said. ""I would put Amazon on the wall. I would paint it on the billboards and I would say, we are going to find a way to beat Amazon because that is what's going to change the game here."" On top of the Amazon issue, Johnson also commented about the detrimental effect on retail if the border-adjustment tax was to be implemented.  ""We're in a very difficult time. Many retailers are on the brink as they begin to close stores, as the malls they're in start to close and change, so it's a very difficult environment. And you add something like a major need to put a price increase on products and it could have a very serious impact on many,"" Johnson said.  ""Almost every retailer is forecasting comp sales flat or down next year. If you have a border tax and they're forced to raise prices, that's going to further decrease their sales and keep people out of stores.""","[In, retail, world, trying, stand, Amazon, J, C, Penney, CEO, retail, Apple, Ron, Johnson, say, retailer, truly, making, effort, The, In, retail, world, trying, stand, Amazon, J, C, Penney, CEO, retail, Apple, Ron, Johnson, say, retailer, truly, making, effort, The, retailer, truly, taking, Amazon, seriously, Walmart, In, retail, world, trying, stand, Amazon, J, C, Penney, CEO, retail, Apple, Ron, Johnson, say, retailer, truly, making, effort, The, retailer, truly, taking, Amazon, seriously, Walmart, Johnson, In, retail, world, trying, stand, Amazon, J, C, Penney, CEO, retail, Apple, Ron, Johnson, say, retailer, truly, making, effort, The, retailer, truly, taking, Amazon, seriously, Walmart, Johnson, ...]",1.0

NFLX,"Netflix, Inc.",27:Why Hulu is hoping to turn old ‘Golden Girls’ episodes into a gold mine,"Saturday, 28 Jan 2017 |  2:00  PM ET","  Come Feb. 13, Hulu is hoping some viewers thank them for being a friend.    On that date, the streaming service has exclusive streaming rights to all 180 episodes of ""The Golden Girls"" — the hit 1980s sitcom about four older women living the single life in Miami — available in its digital library.     More than two decades after its last episode aired, ""The Golden Girls"" remains a cultural touchstone, and helped turn now-95-year-old Betty White into one of America's enduring sweethearts.     Although ""The Golden Girls"" was ranked by the Writers Guild of America at number 69 of its 101 best written series of all time, the show is less of a cultural phenomenon than a ratings juggernaut like ""Seinfeld"" — raising the question of whether the show can pay dividends in the competitive landscape of streaming media.  ""The Golden Girls"" ""has really stood the test of time and is still resonating with audiences. So, when the opportunity came up to license it, we knew we had to take it,"" a Hulu spokesperson explained to CNBC.     In 2015, Hulu made headlines when it landed ""Seinfeld"" for an amount reported to be between $130 million and $180 million. The spokesperson told CNBC that as a matter of policy, Hulu does not divulge how much it pays for content licensing agreements, but defended the ""Golden Girls"" acquisition as a good bet.    ""In identifying potential acquisitions, we're constantly looking for TV shows that viewers consistently talk about but aren't yet able to stream,"" he said.     Fair enough, but can a group of retirees from the 1980s pull in the viewers needed to justify the investment?   ""Given the fact that shows like 'Seinfeld' and 'The Golden Girls' run so frequently in syndication, it may seem counterintuitive for streaming services to have such significant interest,"" said Elizabeth Yuko, an adjunct professor of ethics at Fordham University who has studied the influence of ""The Golden Girls"" on bioethics.    Hulu's move makes perfect sense in a certain context, Yuko told CNBC. ""A lot of the younger generations no longer subscribe to cable … and therefore don't have access to shows like 'The Golden Girls' that we think of as airing constantly.""    Christopher Coby, senior research analyst at 7Park Data, a company that analyzes viewership trends on several streaming media services, including Hulu, said that any streaming service hoping to make a splash with viewers needed a full slate of comedy programs for viewers to choose from. He suspects Baby Boomers — and perhaps their adult children — would glom onto ""The Golden Girls"" when it becomes available.   ""Comedy accounts for the most streams of any TV genre,"" Coby told CNBC, adding that around 20 percent of Hulu TV streams are comedy, for largely competitive reasons. Streaming giant Netflix holds nearly 40 percent of the streaming market, according to 2015 Nielsen data, while Amazon holds 13 percent. Hulu brings up the rear at 6.5 percent.   ""Hulu must defend against Netflix and Amazon,"" Coby said. ""For Hulu, continuing to build on a core of library TV is an important part of the growth picture."" Netflix already has a big leg up with some of the more iconic TV franchises of the 80s and 90s, he added, including  ""Cheers,"" ""The Wonder Years"" and ""Friends."" Currently, Amazon licenses ""Family Ties,"" ""Dynasty"" and ""Sex and the City.""    Daniel Malak, an associate at data analytics firm Motionloft, said that the acquisition may be an attempt to court other key groups such as lesbians, gays and bisexuals — a demographic where ""The Golden Girls"" is wildly popular. Recent estimates place LGBT purchasing power at nearly $1 trillion, making them an attractive advertising target for Hulu, Malak said.   Fordham's Yuko added that the ""The Golden Girls"" reappearance on a new medium like Hulu has major nostalgic value, and presents an opportunity to introduce a new generation.   For someone like Emily Taffel, a 36-year-old public relations executive who lives in the ""Golden Girls'"" old stomping grounds of Miami, Hulu's latest deal is an opportunity for both nostalgia and comfort.

Have you ever been a victim of credit card fraud?  Thirty-nine percent of North Americans have been affected by cybersecurity crime in the past year alone, Symantec Chief Executive Greg Clack told CNBC on Thursday. ""I think that's a very big crisis."" ""I'm really excited about bringing digital safety to our customers,"" Clark said in an interview on ""Squawk Box."" And despite recent earnings misses from peers Palo Alto Networks and FireEye, Clark doesn't think there's ""weakness"" overall in the sector. Network security company Palo Alto Networks reported fiscal second-quarter revenue Tuesday that missed forecasts, and its shares plunged nearly 17 percent in after-hours trading. The company's stock was up slightly in early trading Thursday. In February, shares of FireEye plummeted on news the software maker's quarterly revenue fell short of expectations. The company also announced its chairman and chief financial officer were leaving the company. FireEye shares were up slightly in early trading Thursday. Symantec has a better story to tell, as the company has managed to drive revenue growth and top analysts' earnings expectations over the past three quarters, Clark said. ""We feel really good about the future,"" he told CNBC, speaking specifically to the opportunities provided by Symantec's latest major LifeLock deal. Last November, Symantec announced it was acquiring U.S. identity theft protection services company LifeLock for $2.3 billion, in a move that it hoped would boost sales at Symantec's Norton unit. ""We feel good about taking Norton subscribers and offering them protection through LifeLock,"" Clark said in the ""Squawk Box"" interview. The LifeLock transaction is not expected to have a material impact on Symantec's 2017 financial results, and the company also reaffirmed its 2018 earnings guidance in a press release after the announcement in November. Symantec said it expects the purchase to be accretive to earnings in 2019.

MMM,3M Company,"2:Cramer gets down & dirty, finds Dow stocks that can keep the rally roaring past 20k","Wednesday, 25 Jan 2017 |  6:14  PM ET","  Jim Cramer decided to get his hands dirty, digging into the Dow Jones industrial average to figure out if the move to 20,000 was justified.    As of this point in earning season, 15 Dow members have reported earnings. Of the 15, Cramer found at least 13 with numbers that indicate the rally is the real deal.    ""This move is not alchemy, it is not animal spirits. It is the earnings, which is the best reason to rally,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.   No. 1 was American Express, which went down after reporting earnings. Cramer thinks this is a big mistake, and expects it to head back to the $90s.    No. 2 was Boeing, whose results impressed Cramer, especially with its profitable Dreamliner.    No. 3, DuPont, reported a very strong quarter, leaving Cramer simply amazed. He attributed the success to CEO Ed Breen, who is in the process of merging with Dow Chemical.    No. 4, General Electric, missed out big time, Cramer said. He was disappointed with the execution and confused by moves made with oil and gas, along with its shortfall in the turbine business.     ""Don't look for GE for help now that we have broken out above Dow 20,000,"" Cramer said.  Goldman Sachs checked in at number 5, and is in a great position to benefit from deregulation and rate hikes. The last quarter was reported before these elements were even implemented, so Cramer could only salivate over what it could deliver once the backdrop improves.  IBM was sixth, and traded down initially on its conference call—making Cramer convinced sellers were insane. Forty percent of IBM's business is growing like a young startup. He thinks it's time to pay more, not less for the stock, and said it could go to $200.    No. 7, Johnson and Johnson, did not have a weak quarter, despite what naysayers believe, Cramer said. In a world that is less reliant on Donald Trump and less cyclical, he said it is a buy.  JPMorgan, which just delivered the best quarter it has ever reported, was number 8. On virtually every metric, the company simply has no peer, Cramer said. Yet the stock is still cheap at only 13 times earnings.     No. 9 was McDonald's, making Cramer feel lonely for liking the stock on the conference call. He said the stock is just fine, and doesn't agree that the company is done reinventing itself.    No. 10, 3M, is so innovative, Cramer wouldn't be surprised to see if it led the way higher from here as consumers snap back.  Procter &amp; Gamble, at number 11, was ready when the dollar strengthened and had a large boost from earnings, large gains in market share and restructuring that is paying off. If the stock comes down, Cramer said it will be bought.    No. 12, Travelers, just delivered a clean beat when it earned $3.20 a share when Wall Street was only looking for $2.81.   ""Look for this insurance company's investment portfolio to give you some real vig this year as rates go higher on risk-free securities. Travelers hates risk,"" Cramer said.  At number 13, UnitedHealth has a pattern of blowing away numbers, followed by the stock falling into a funk as investors assess the quarter. Cramer believes that this stock is on the right side of President Donald Trump, because of its criticism of Obamacare.    No. 14 was United Technologies, which delivered again. The numbers were so superb, investors didn't notice the couple of pennies per share Trump knocked off the company's earnings by keeping jobs in Indiana.  Verizon, which logged in at number 15, was terrible, Cramer said. It was losing share all over the place, and was by far the worst in show.    ""If the numbers from the other 15 Dow stocks are even close to this good, we could have a lot more room to run,"" Cramer said.    Questions for Cramer?

C,Citigroup Inc.,1:Cramer: Top sector you should pile into as the economy strengthens,"Wednesday,  8 Mar 2017 |  6:28  PM ET","Jim Cramer has been preaching to investors that the market's recent strength has less to do with who is in the White House, and more to do with an improving global economy. Whenever there is an economic expansion, one of Cramer's top sectors to pile into is the chemical industry. ""This is one of the most cyclical businesses on earth, so when economies around the world get stronger, the chemical companies tend to see their earnings rocket higher,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. Two of Cramer's favorite names in the chemical space are Albemarle Corporation and FMC Corp, and he thinks they are too good to ignore right now. ﻿Watch the full segment here: Albemarle makes technologically-advanced specialty chemicals used by various industries, including lithium used for recharging batteries. Cramer noted that the lithium business has been booming, thanks to an increase in hybrid and electric cars. The company reported earnings last week, and reported a blowout quarter, complete with an earnings beat and a massive beat in revenue. Even better, management gave strong guidance for the full year, much higher than analysts expected. Citigroup downgraded Albemarle to ""neutral"" in the wake of the post-earnings rally, citing that the stock has become too expensive. However, Cramer was willing to take the other side of the trade on this one. FMC is a diversified chemical company that serves the agriculture, consumer and industrial end markets. It makes generic and off-patent pesticides and herbicides, along with food ingredients that provide texture, color and restructure. It also has exposure to the lithium space, though FMC's exposure is smaller as a percentage of the overall company than Albemarle. Cramer considers FMC to be a play on crop protection, as it gets more than 70 percent if sales from its agriculture division. Within that agriculture division, it gets approximately 40 percent of sales from Latin America, which is a big deal since both Latin America and Brazil have been making a comeback. However, the last time FMC reported in February, Wall Street considered the quarter to be a disappointment, with earnings and revenue missing estimates. Even worse, management provided guidance for the following quarter that was much weaker than analysts expected. When Cramer dug into his homework, he found that the positives were overshadowed by weak headline numbers. And while the guidance was subpar, its full-year earnings guidance for 2017 was solid. In fact, back in 2016, FMC provided a weak outlook and then the company beat its own forecast. That led Cramer to suspect that management is simply being conservative with an under promise and over deliver approach. ""This is a great time to be a chemical company … and even better time to be in the lithium business, which is why I want to reiterate that both Albemarle and FMC Corp are worth buying right here,"" Cramer said.

INTC,Intel Corporation,11:Here's how Intel's CEO explained his White House appearance to employees,"Wednesday,  8 Feb 2017 |  6:09  PM ET","Intel announced a new investment in an Arizona factory on Wednesday — and it did so at the Oval Office, not its Santa Clara, Calif. headquarters. The reason? To show support of the administration's ""policies to level the global playing field,"" especially when it comes to taxes, CEO Brian Krzanich told employees in a company email. ""From a tax and regulatory position we have been disadvantaged relative to the rest of the world where we compete,"" the email said. ""That's why we support the [a]dministration's policies to level the global playing field and make U.S. manufacturing competitive worldwide through new regulatory standards and investment policies."" The factory is not new — it has been in the works for several years, Krzanich said, and was even used by the Obama administration ""as a symbol of the future of U.S. manufacturing,"" before falling vacant, The Arizona Republic reported.   Here's what President Barack Obama said at  Intel's construction site for the factory in 2012:  ""We have a huge opportunity to create more high-tech manufacturing jobs in the United States, and bring some of these jobs back from overseas. But we're going to have to seize the moment. That starts with changing our tax system.""  But the new $7 billion investment to finish the factory reflects support of new policies,  Krzanich told reporters on Wednesday. It also reflects the pressure to make smaller, faster chips despite scientific challenges, a principle that ""marches on"" for the company's business, he said. ""We've held off doing this investment until now,"" Krzanich told reporters at the announcement. ""It's really in support of the tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward. That will really make it advantageous to do it in the U.S.""  There will be no incentives from the federal government for the Intel project, the White House said. ""Brian called a few weeks ago and said, 'We want to do a big announcement,'"" President Donald Trump said at the Wednesday announcement.  The factory will eventually employ about 3,000 and support about 10,000 jobs, Intel said. But when asked if Intel would bring back jobs from overseas,  Krzanich replied, ""This is about expansion — new jobs in the U.S.""  Intel has drawn fire from both political sides for some of its actions. It has been criticized in conservative publications such as Breitbart for laying off thousands of staffers, while simultaneously supporting legislation that would increase the number of foreign worker visas granted each year. Krzanich was also reportedly planning a fundraiser for Trump during the campaign season —which he later canceled. Neil Campling, senior vice-president and head of global TMT research at Northern Trust Securities, said there will be ""massive"" technical challenges for Intel to make the chip plant a reality.  ""Now this announcement tonight is probably because of the semiconductor demand we have alluded to in great detail in recent weeks, more than it is about [Trump],"" Campling wrote in a note. ""In this industry, talk is cheap until the production ramps. It is safer/more logical to focus on the companies who follow through with clear strategic plans.""  Still, Intel's email to employees said, ""When we disagree, we don't walk away.""  Here's the full email:  Today I was proud to represent Intel at the White House, where we announced that Intel is investing $7b illion to complete a manufacturing facility that will produce the most advanced computer chips in the world. Fab 42 will create about 3,000 full-time Intel jobs and more than 10,000 jobs in Arizona to run and support the factory.Fab 42 is an investment in our own future and will help ensure that the United States remains the global leader in the semiconductor industry. The 7 nanometer (nm) chips that we're targeting for this factory — the smallest, most powerful and efficient ever — will power state-of-the-art computers, data centers, and other high-tech devices. They will enable amazing breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, automated driving, medical research and treatment, and the factories of the future.I would like to take some time to answer some of the questions that are probably on your mind about this investment and the timing.  The first question that may come to mind is ""why now?"" The answer is relatively simple. Intel's business continues to grow, and investment in capacity and R&amp;D ensures that the pace of Moore's Law continues to march on, fueling technology innovations we love and depend on. Leading-edge technologies like 7 nm require an increasing amount of factory space per wafer. These two factors have driven Intel to a point where we must get to work and build out another factory for 7 nm capacity. These state-of-the-artfactories take a couple of years to build out capacity and begin the start-up process. As a result, we made the decision to start the process now. We are excited to begin this journey to build the world's most advanced and complex factory producing Intel's 7 nm technology.The second question is why did we choose to do this announcement at the White House? Intel is proud of the fact that the majority of our wafer manufacturing and R&amp;D is based in the United States. This is due to the great infrastructure we have at our U.S. sites, our talented and highly skilled workforce and the proximity to our R&amp;D facilities in Oregon. We've maintained this U.S.-based manufacturing even though approximately 80 percent of our product is sold outside the United States—we're one of the top 5 exporters and top 2 R&amp;D spenders in the U.S.—and despite the fact that from a tax and regulatory position we have been disadvantaged relative to the rest of the world where we compete. That's why we support the Administration's policies to level the global playing field and make U.S. manufacturing competitive worldwide through new regulatory standards and investment policies.Government policies play a critical role in enabling and sustaining American-driven innovation. At Intel we meet with governments from around the world, discussing and debating issues and policies important to our business, employees and shareholders. When we disagree, we don't walk away. We believe that we must be part of the conversation to voice our views on key issues such as immigration, H1B visas and other policies that are essential to innovation. We are an American innovation company that drives growth and opportunity in the United States and inevery corner of the world. I hope you join me in being proud that Intel, the largest and most advanced semiconductor company in the world, continues to invest and invent to push the boundaries of technology.I also hope you will join me and several members of my team for an employee open forum and webcast on Thursday. We look forward to discussing this announcement with you in more detail and answering your questions.Others predict the future. At Intel, we build it. Today's announcement is the latest exciting chapter in our almost 50-year story of innovation that is changing the world.Brian — CNBC's Jacob Pramuk and Arjun Kharpal contributed to this report.","[Intel, announced, investment, Arizona, factory, Wednesday, Oval, Office, Santa, Clara, Calif, headquarters, The, reason, To, show, support, administration, policy, level, said, used, Obama, administration, symbol, future, U, S, manufacturing, falling, vacant, The, Arizona, Republic, reported, Here, President, Barack, Obama, said, Intel, construction, site, factory, We, huge, opportunity, create, tech, manufacturing, job, United, States, bring, job, overseas, But, going, seize, moment, announcement, It, really, support, tax, regulatory, policy, administration, pushing, forward, That, really, make, advantageous, U, S, There, incentive, federal, government, Intel, project, White, House, said, Brian, called, ago, said, We, want, big, announcement, President, Donald, Trump, said, Wednesday, announcement, The, ...]",1.0

AMGN,Amgen Inc.,2:Cramer fires back at naysayers: Here's your proof that this rally is real,"Wednesday, 15 Feb 2017 |  6:22  PM ET","Jim Cramer is sick and tired of investors doubting that the stock market could really power higher. It is the real deal, he said, and he decided to prove it. ""It is one of the oldest theories when it comes to stocks that the transports have to confirm the strength in the Dow industrials before you can trust a rally … that is exactly what is happening,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. The theory of transports pertains to the notion that the transports group must make a new high at the same time as the Dow for the market to have solid grounding. And the good news is that the railroad stocks, truckers, freight forwarders and airlines are all leading the way, which means the rally is backed by an increase in commerce. ""It is the numbers themselves that are driving things, not the hoped-for-prospect of tax relief,"" Cramer said. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a significant $8 billion commitment to the U.S. airline industry on Tuesday. It was clear to Cramer that Buffett is a buyer because he thinks there is value in the airlines. They are inexpensive stocks relative to the rest of the market, and because of structure changes in the industry they are now also profitable. Cramer isn't about to bet on Buffett as some yahoo that doesn't know what he's doing. The leaders of the stock market were also evidence to Cramer that the rally is the real deal. The best acting group thus far has been the financials, which act as gasoline to the entire market. If bank stocks rise, it is a sign that they are taking in more money form customers and either lending it out at good rates or buying Treasurys, buying back stock and paying higher dividends than they currently do. Or both. Even better, the Federal Reserve is expected to raise rates multiple times this year, and this is fantastic news for the banks. ""I can tell you that when the bank stocks roar higher and are good investments, then commercial lending and economic expansion aren't far behind,"" Cramer said. Even the technology and biotech stocks that have sat on the sidelines for years and are now undervalued on earnings are leading the way, too. Stocks like Amgen, Celgene and Gilead all reported strong quarters. Housing stocks are also gaining strength, which wouldn't occur if higher interest rates were about to negatively impact the industry. Questions for Cramer?

AET,Aetna Inc.,15:3 things to watch during Tom Price’s confirmation hearing,"Wednesday, 18 Jan 2017 |  6:14  AM ET","  Having served as the chair of the House Budget committee, Rep. Tom Price knows a thing or two about congressional hearings. But this time President-elect Donald Trump's pick for secretary of Health and Human Services will be in the hot seat, when he goes before the Senate in the first of two confirmation hearings on Wednesday.      The six-term Republican from Georgia has been one of the leading opponents to Obamacare in Congress, and an advocate for the restructuring of the Medicaid and Medicare health entitlement programs. Democrats have vowed to fight the nomination of Price, an orthopedic surgeon.    Price's confirmation hearing before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee will be a warmup for his appearance before the Senate Finance Committee, which will actually vote on his nomination.     Here are three hot-button issues to watch:   Price vowed to divest stock holdings if confirmed. In a letter to congressional ethics regulators last week, he listed holdings of more than three dozen stocks, including health-related companies Aetna, Biogen and Zimmer Biomet Holdings.    Democratic Sens. Al Franken of Minnesota, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin have raised questions about conflicts of interests arising from his trading in health-care stocks as a member of Congress.     Price has proposed restructuring Medicare funding by converting traditional Medicare into more of a market-based system, a move he says will prevent the health entitlement program from going broke.        Critics charge that this could raise health-care costs for the elderly and reduce their access to medical care through limited networks.     Trump has opposed privatizing Medicare.    This isn't the only policy where Price is at odds with his boss. Price has opposed giving Medicare authority for negotiating drug prices, but in an interview with The Washington Post, Trump again said he wants to push for drug-price negotiation as part of his administration's replacement of Obamacare.    The Congressional Budget Office on Tuesday estimated that the GOP's repeal effort would result in 32 million people losing health insurance coverage in 10 years, and that premiums in the individual market would likely increase 20 to 25 percent in the first year after repeal, and double by 2026.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose about 10 points, closing at a record high, with Chevron contributing the most losses and 3M the most gains. The S&amp;P 500 dropped 0.1 percent, with energy leading decliners. ""The SPX looks poised for several days of consolidation as it digests recent gains,"" said Katie Stockton, chief technical strategist at BTIG. ""However, we believe the SPX can reach our Q1 target of 2400 before a significant pullback, and would keep a bullish bias."" The Nasdaq composite declined 0.1 percent. The major indexes posted fresh intraday highs earlier in the session. ""I think the market has a problem here, and that is complacency,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. ""Investors are getting ahead of themselves with the prospects of Trump moving forward with tax reform."" The three major indexes, along with the small-caps Russell 2000, closed at new all-time highs again on Wednesday, as President Donald Trump continued touting his economic agenda consisting of three key themes: deregulation, corporate tax cuts and fiscal stimulus. Wednesday also marked the fifth straight day with the indexes closing at record highs. On Thursday morning, Trump tweeted about the stock market's recent run.  Economic data continued to come in strong Thursday, with weekly jobless claims holding around their lowest levels in more than 40 years, while the Philadelphia Federal Reserve manufacturing index hit its highest level since January 1984. ""The ebullience speaks for itself as manufacturers will be a main beneficiary of any corporate tax changes. This joins a slew of euphoric sentiment indicators that we've seen for months but the actual rate of economic growth right now for Q1 is still estimated to be around the same 2% we've been stuck in,"" said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group, in a note. Inflation data released earlier this week, along with testimony from Fed Chair Janet Yellen, lifted market expectations for a rate hike in March. According to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, expectations for a March move were at 22 percent. In corporate news, investors parsed through quarterly results from CBS, Wendy's, Alexion Pharmaceuticals and Marriott, among other firms. U.S. Treasurys rose on Thursday, with the benchmark 10-year yield falling to 2.45 percent and the short-term two-year note yield holding around 1.21 percent. The dollar fell 0.7 percent against a basket of currencies, with the euro near $1.066 and the yen around 113.3. Overseas, European stocks declined, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index sliding 0.37 percent. In Asia, the Nikkei 225 fell 0.47 percent while the Shanghai composite advanced 0.52 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 7.91 points, or 0.04 percent, to close at 20,619.77, with Cisco Systems leading advancers and Chevron the top decliner.

The Nasdaq composite declined 4.54 points, or 0.08 percent, to close at 5,814. About four stocks declined for every three advancers at the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 853.02 million and a composite volume of 3.653 billion at the close.

In Japan, the Nikkei Stock Average ended down 0.47 percent, or 90.45 points, at 19,347.53.  Toshiba shares continued their decline on Thursday, falling 3.34percent, extending a more than 8 percent drop in Wednesday's session amid mounting troubles. Reuters, citing sources, reported Toshiba may delay the sale of its prized flash-memory chip unit as it scrambles for cash to stay in business, after booking a massive multi-billion dollar hit to its U.S. nuclear unit. The company has delayed releasing its earnings results.  ""We believe Toshiba's delay in reporting its financial results is due to poor internal controls at its U.S. nuclear-power subsidiary, Westinghouse Electric,"" said Masako Kuwahara, a senior analyst at ratings agency Moody's, in a note on Thursday. ""Toshiba is already in a deleterious financial position,"" Kuwahara said. ""The delay in reporting its results and the substantial impairment charge pose further credit negatives for the company.""

Australia's ASX 200 ended slightly higher, rising 0.12 percent, or 7.226 points, to 5816.30.  In regional company news, Singapore's top lender DBS Group said Thursday that net profit in the fourth quarter of 2016 fell nearly 9 percent from the year-earlier quarter to S$913 million. DBS shares advanced 1.59 percent. Views on U.S. interest rates were also in focus as  New York Fed President William Dudley said Wednesday that a rate hike could come soon. ""We expect to gradually remove further monetary policy accommodation and snug up interest rates a little bit further in the months ahead,"" Dudley said. The Fed has forecast as many as three rate hikes this year, with the policymaking committee's next meeting set for March. Overnight, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen testified in front of Congress for the second straight day on Wednesday. She acknowledged the economy was weak, but said Fed policies have helped and the economy is close to achieving the Fed's goals on employment and inflation. On Tuesday, Yellen raised market expectations for a March rate hike after saying it would be ""unwise"" for the Fed to wait too long. Analysts were sanguine on how a Fed hike might affect markets. ""What's most important here is that the market is just so comfortable with a somewhat hawkish Fed and we can even go as far as saying hawkish commentary is now being taken as an equity positive,"" said Chris Weston, chief market strategist at spreadbettor IG, in a note. In the currency market, the dollar slipped against a basket of currencies to trade at 100.84 as of 4:50 p.m. HK/SIN, down from levels above 101.50 in the previous session. The yen strengthened against the greenback to trade at 113.67 at 4:50 p.m. HK/SIN, climbing from the last close at 114.15. The stronger yen sent Japanese exporters lower, with major automakers in the red. Toyota shares fell 0.52 percent, Nissan was down 0.31 percent and Honda fell 0.61 percent. Electronics maker Sony dropped 0.97 percent.  Elsewhere, the euro fetched $1.0607 and the Australian dollar was at $0.7698.

Lien said the loss of momentum in the dollar likely came from an ""unexpected decline in industrial production"" and Yellen's remarks on the economy. ""Investors latched onto these words even though she spent more of her Congressional testimony talking about solid consumer spending, and the pickup in business and consumer confidence,"" she said.

Shares of the chain surged more than 17 percent in heavy trading, leading the S&amp;P Retail Index higher and pushing the company's stock back into positive territory for 2017. Shares had tumbled earlier this year, at one point losing 30 percent of their value in four days, after the retailer outlined plans to close 150 stores and lay off employees at remaining locations.The stock closed the day up more than 15 percent, holding right above $9.  Though Sears on Thursday reported another quarterly loss, its results were an improvement over the prior-year period. The company lost an adjusted $1.28 per share during the fiscal fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $1.70 a year earlier.  Meanwhile, the company outlined plans to use some of the proceeds from its asset sales to fund payments to its pension plan. To stay afloat, Sears has been tapping into CEO Eddie Lampert's piggy bank and monetizing its real estate. It also recently sold its Craftsman brand.  ""In our view this is little more than a short-term survival tactic, where funds raised are used to prop up a failing business rather than generate long-term growth,"" Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, told investors Thursday. Despite its financial maneuvers and a leaner cost structure, Sears revenue loss accelerated from a year ago. Sales slid 17 percent during the holiday period, compared with a 10 percent drop a year earlier.

DVA,DaVita Inc.,1:Dialysis providers won't have to disclose financial aid to patients,"Thursday, 26 Jan 2017 | 11:52  AM ET","  Companies that provide dialysis have won a big victory as a federal judge suspended implementation of a last-minute Obama administration rule that would have forced the disclosure of financial aid given to patients.    That rule has been bitterly opposed by dialysis providers, who fear that insurance plans would use information about patients who got such aid to deny insurance coverage to them for dialysis procedures. The rule would have required that insurers agree to accept third-party financial aid for their customers.   U.S. District Judge Amos Mazzant, in granting providers and dialysis advocates a temporary restraining order against the rule, said that the federal Health and Human Service Department's issuance of the rule had been ""arbitrary and capricious.""    Mazzant also said that the plaintiffs opposing the rule had a high likelihood of getting it permanently tossed out because there is good reason to believe HHS did not follow the proper procedure for giving the public notice and a chance to comment on the proposed rule.    ""The Court determines that HHS did not have good cause to bypass notice and comment; thus, the Rule should be vacated,"" Mazzant wrote in his decision, issued in federal court in Texas.    The rule was announced in mid-December, and had been scheduled to take effect Jan. 14. An earlier Mazzant ruling postponed the implementation pending his consideration of a request for the temporary restraining order from the plaintiffs, which included the providers DaVita, Fresenius Medical Care and U.S. Renal Care, along with a dialysis patients organization.    The Justice Department, which is defending the rule, declined to comment.    DaVita said, ""On behalf of our patients we are pleased that the court took the important step of putting a hold on a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) rule that would have harmed  thousands of the sickest patients in America."" CMS is a division of HHS.   Hrant Jamgochian, chief executive of Dialysis Patient Citizens, a leading advocacy group for people with kidney disease and the lead plaintiff in the suit, said, ""The court recognized the critical need to suspend enforcement of a harmful regulation that would give insurers illegal veto power over a patient's ability to receive charitable assistance that helps them afford health insurance."" ""CMS hastily released the rule without recognizing its harmful impact on patients' ability to keep their current health plan,"" Jamgochian said.   The case stems fromconcerns raised by federal health regulators that some dialysis providers — by funding insurance premiums paid by patients — are steering people into private individual health plans when those patients are either getting or eligible for government-run Medicare and Medicaid insurance coverage.    Last summer, regulators warned that such steering could drive up health costs nationally, and hurt the bottom lines of insurers.    Private insurance plans, including those sold on Obamacare exchanges, pay higher reimbursement rates for dialysis treatment than Medicare and Medicaid.    After that warning, some insurers complained about dialysis providers giving patients financial aid, as they do via donations to the charities such as the American Kidney Fund.    DaVita, in a statement to CNBC, noted that the judge had found that the rule would have left ""thousands of Medicare-ineligible [dialysis] patients without health insurance,"" and that the government ""has long accepted the practice of charitable premium assistance.""     DaVita said despite the judge's ruling, ""the threat to dialysis patients by health insurance providers still exists.""    ""We ask the new administration and CMS to not only eliminate this rule, but to take action to prevent insurance companies from discriminating against a vulnerable group of patients and ensure continued access to charitable premium assistance that has served as an essential patient safety net for the last 20 years.""","[December, scheduled, take, effect, Jan, An, earlier, Mazzant, ruling, postponed, implementation, pending, consideration, request, temporary, restraining, order, plaintiff, included, provider, DaVita, Fresenius, Medical, Care, U, S, Renal, Care, dialysis, patient, organization, The, Justice, Department, defending, declined, comment, DaVita, said, On, plaintiff, included, provider, DaVita, Fresenius, Medical, Care, U, S, Renal, Care, dialysis, patient, organization, The, Justice, Department, defending, declined, comment, DaVita, said, On, behalf, patient, pleased, court, took, important, step, putting, hold, Centers, Medicare, Medicaid, Services, CMS, harmed, thousand, sickest, rate, dialysis, treatment, Medicare, Medicaid, After, warning, insurer, complained, dialysis, provider, giving, patient, financial, aid, donation, charity, American, Kidney, Fund, ...]",1.0

CAT,"Caterpillar, Inc.",6:Caterpillar Is Accused in Report to Federal Investigators of Tax Fraud,"Tuesday,  7 Mar 2017 |  9:53  PM ET","﻿For years, federal investigators have been scrutinizing Caterpillar's overseas tax affairs with no resolution to the examinations of the complex maneuvers involving billions of dollars and one of the company's Swiss subsidiaries. Now, a report commissioned by the government and reviewed by The New York Times accuses the heavy-equipment maker of carrying out tax and accounting fraud. It is extremely rare to accuse a big multinational company of tax fraud, which could result in high penalties. More from the New York Times:U.S. Agents Raid Caterpillar Over Offshore Tax Practices Economic Scene: Trump Budget Proposal Reflects Working-Class Resentment of the Poor The Parts of Obamacare Republicans Will Keep, Change or Discard ""Caterpillar did not comply with either U.S. tax law or U.S. financial reporting rules,"" wrote Leslie A. Robinson, an accounting professor at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College and the author of the report. ""I believe that the company's noncompliance with these rules was deliberate and primarily with the intention of maintaining a higher share price. These actions were fraudulent rather than negligent."" No charges have been filed, and it is not clear whether investigators agree with the findings or intend to act on them. The report, which has not been made public or made available to Caterpillar, outlines a company strategy for bringing home billions of dollars from offshore affiliates while avoiding federal income taxes on those earnings. Corrie Heck Scott, a Caterpillar spokeswoman, pointed out that the company had not been provided with a copy of the report and declined to comment further. The company, which makes heavy construction and mining equipment, has defended its tax strategies in previous years by calling the arrangements prudent and lawful among large United States companies. Caterpillar's strategies for reducing the taxes it must pay in the United States have saved the company billions of dollars. Last week, federal agents raided three Caterpillar buildings near its headquarters in Peoria, Ill., as part of the investigation. Caterpillar said it was cooperating with law enforcement. The company's tax practices have been a focus of government investigators since a 2014 Senate hearing found that the company cut its tax bill by $2.4 billion over 13 years, moving earnings out of the United States and into a Swiss subsidiary, despite internal company warnings that the strategy lacked a business purpose, other than tax avoidance. Less than a year later, Caterpillar disclosed it received a subpoena from federal investigators seeking documents and information relating to the movement of cash among domestic and overseas subsidiaries, as well as other matters involving its foreign units, including the Swiss entity. The company has since disclosed in securities filings that the Internal Revenue Service is seeking more than $2 billion in income taxes and penalties on profits earned by the Swiss unit. Caterpillar has said it is ""vigorously contesting"" the I.R.S.'s proposed increases. Reached by telephone, Ms. Robinson declined to comment. Her report focused on one specific part of Caterpillar's offshore tax arrangement. It concluded that the company failed to pay taxes on billions of dollars brought home primarily from its Swiss unit and its affiliates, and thus failed to comply with United States tax law and financial reporting rules. It is not clear which federal agency hired Ms. Robinson. In her report she wrote that she was asked to provide a written opinion of Caterpillar's financial reporting related to various tax accounting standards, ""as pertaining to"" the investigation of Caterpillar by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General. ""I was provided with all documents available to the case agents assigned to the investigation,"" Ms. Robinson wrote. She also wrote that she spent approximately 200 hours reviewing the evidence and performing calculations. The investigation is being conducted by the United States attorney's office for the Central District of Illinois as well as the Inspector General of the F.D.I.C., which investigates criminal activities affecting financial institutions. Agents from that office, as well as from the I.R.S. and the Department of Commerce's office of export enforcement joined the raid on Caterpillar's offices last week. A spokeswoman and a spokesman for the agencies confirmed last week's law enforcement activity and the agencies involved, but declined to comment further. United States companies owe corporate income taxes at a rate of 35 percent on profits earned around the world. However, they are permitted to defer the taxes owed on the profits generated offshore until they bring those earnings back to the States, a process known as repatriation. Once they bring cash back, they generally owe federal income taxes, with a credit for any income taxes they have already paid overseas. In the report, Ms. Robinson estimated that Caterpillar has brought back $7.9 billion into the States, structured as loans, over and beyond the income that had already been taxed overseas. She concluded that the company failed to report those loans for tax or accounting purposes, and she wrote that those profits should be subject to federal taxes. In one example, she cited correspondence between the company and the Securities and Exchange Commission in which Caterpillar said it had $2.5 billion of income eligible to be brought to the United States tax-free. Ms. Robinson wrote that her research showed that the company did not have ""anywhere near"" that sum still available to be brought in tax-free. Caterpillar failed to report those loans as taxable distributions of cash, thus avoiding the tax on earnings brought home from Switzerland, while ""enjoying the use of those earnings to meet U.S. cash needs,"" she wrote. Ms. Robinson's 85-page analysis is based on publicly available and internal financial data of the company, she wrote in the report, as well as bank data tracking wire transfers from Switzerland into the United States. The report does not explain whether Caterpillar used the type of creative, and often legal, transactions that United States multinationals use to avoid tax on earnings brought home from offshore. For instance, while companies typically owe tax on earnings brought home, there some exceptions. For instance, they do not owe tax on short-term loans made by their offshore subsidiaries to their domestic parent company. In her report, Ms. Robinson does not mention this legal exception, and it is unclear if Caterpillar used such transactions. In 2012, the same Senate committee that examined Caterpillar's taxes found that Hewlett-Packard stitched together a series of such loans to bring home billions of dollars tax-free. The 2014 Senate report on Caterpillar said the company worked with the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, to set up its Swiss tax-cutting strategy. PwC was also the company's auditor, which raised ""significant conflict of interest concerns,"" according to Senate investigators. The report by Ms. Robinson makes a passing reference to PwC but does not address what role, if any, it had in these transactions. Caroline Nolan, a spokeswoman for PwC, said, ""We don't comment on client matters or pending investigations."" Companies like Caterpillar, Google, Apple and Pfizer have accumulated at least $2.3 trillion offshore, much of it in subsidiaries located in tax havens like Bermuda, Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands. President Trump has said he supports a holiday of sorts that would permit companies to bring those profits back to the United States at a low rate.

TGT,Target Corporation,3:Target's $7 billion spending plan still leaves some question marks,"Wednesday,  1 Mar 2017 |  5:56  AM ET","It's Target's turn to feel the pain. Nearly a year and a half after Wal-Mart said investments into its stores and employees would dramatically cut into its profits, a similar announcement from Target on Tuesday garnered the same reaction on Wall Street. After CEO Brian Cornell outlined plans for the company to spend $7 billion in cash over the next three years — and forfeit $1 billion in annual operating profit as it lowers prices and invests in stores — the retailer's shares had their worst day since 2008. The sell-off mimicked the one experienced by Wal-Mart in October 2015, when its stock recorded its steepest daily decline in 27 years. It also underscored how much less patient investors can be when bricks-and-mortar retailer invest in their businesses versus online players like Amazon. Yet while investors seemed skeptical about Target's plans, punishing its shares by more than 12 percent, analysts agreed the company is making the right investments for the long term. That doesn't mean, however, that all of its lingering issues have been solved, as traffic and the grocery business remain critical headwinds for the retailer. ""What they're doing is right, but the devil of the details is always going to be in the execution,"" Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, told CNBC. ""The jury's still out as to whether they have a detailed plan to build back traffic."" While many of its competitors are shuttering locations, Target is dialing up its investments in its existing stores. The company plans to renovate some 600 stores over the next three years, including a more elevated presentation of its apparel offerings. Some of these stores haven't been upgraded in a decade, Cornell said. ""We can't capture that market share if we're presenting an old, tired store,"" the CEO said. Meanwhile, Target will accelerate the rollout of its small-format stores that allow it to enter dense urban markets. While these stores carry a higher price tag than its rural, big-box locations, they deliver two times the sales productivity as the average store in its fleet, Cornell said. Importantly, they also serve as another distribution hub for the company's online orders, Moody's analyst Charlie O'Shea said. Target's other planned investments into the supply chain and private label brands also seem logical, as it grows online sales and looks to differentiate its product, O'Shea said. While there's always a risk in creating new brands — particularly as Target is banking on 12 labels to add more than $10 billion in sales over two years —  they should help bring traffic into Target stores, O'Shea said. The retailer's Cat &amp; Jack children's brand, which launched in July, is on pace to reach $1 billion in sales in one year, Cornell said. Still, several challenges remain. Traffic in Target stores has been weak for several quarters, as its decision to sell the pharmacy business to CVS reduced the number of repeat visits to its shops. That's because shoppers have been reluctant or slow to switch their prescriptions over. While Cornell said traffic to its pharmacies has improved in recent quarters, it's facing stiffer competition from Wal-Mart. What's more, CVS was recently cut out of deals that competitor Walgreens made with pharmacy benefits managers, which are expected to result in more than 40 million lost prescriptions. Meanwhile, Target's grocery department continues to be a point of weakness. Though Cornell said the company is not standing idly by when it comes to the category, it's been slow to roll out visible changes. The CEO added that it's not in Target's DNA to be a full-service grocer, and instead views food as an additive purchase for shoppers. While that may be true, it means Target will need to find other ways of bringing shoppers into its stores. In the meantime, Target has increased the frequency of shipments in fresh produce and will roll out some of the changes it's been testing in LA and Dallas.  Grocery accounts for roughly one-fifth of Target's annual revenue. ""Food will always be challenged at Target, at least for the foreseeable future,"" O'Shea said. Analysts were also cautious about Target's decision to challenge Wal-Mart on price, noting that Wal-Mart's scale and vendor relationships will make it a tough battle. Meanwhile, they'll need to increase the speed with which they sell products to help make up for the differential. On the plus side, O'Shea said that lowering prices on food and other household essentials should help Target drive traffic to its stores, while still allowing it to charge a premium for its exclusive apparel and home goods products. ""Reverting to everyday low prices will get them off this promotional merry-go-round that they've been on,"" he said.","[It, Target, turn, feel, pain, Nearly, half, Wal, Mart, said, investment, store, employee, dramatically, cut, profit, similar, announcement, Target, Tuesday, garnered, It, Target, turn, feel, pain, Nearly, half, Wal, Mart, said, investment, store, employee, dramatically, cut, profit, similar, announcement, Target, Tuesday, garnered, reaction, Wall, Street, After, CEO, Brian, Cornell, outlined, plan, company, spend, year, forfeit, operating, profit, lower, price, steepest, decline, year, It, underscored, patient, investor, brick, mortar, retailer, invest, business, versus, online, player, like, Amazon, Yet, investor, skeptical, Target, plan, punishing, share, percent, analyst, agreed, company, making, right, investment, term, That, mean, lingering, issue, solved, traffic, grocery, business, going, ...]",1.0
NKE,"Nike, Inc.","3:For some, sneakers become both a market and an addiction","Saturday, 25 Feb 2017 | 11:02  AM ET"," For most, the annual NBA All-Star Weekend that took place this week is a celebration of the best professional basketball players in the world. Yet, for others, those three consecutive days in the middle of February often mean much more. For so-called ""sneaker heads,"" it's a time that coincides with some of the most anticipated sneaker releases from their favorite brands and players. Earlier this week, NBA superstars like LeBron James, Stephen Curry and James Harden were among those players flaunting All-Star themed colorways and versions of their own sneakers on the court in New Orleans — under the umbrella of big name shoe sponsors like Nike, Under Armour and Adidas. This weekend, Nike is expected to release two retro versions from the wildly popular ""Air Jordan"" line named after basketball legend Michael Jordan. The sneaker industry has exploded into a full-fledged marketplace where a colossus like Nike can reap nearly $8 billion in quarterly brand sales, based in part on demand for designer sneakers. Meanwhile, a pair can be purchased and easily resold on the secondary market for multiples of its original price.  It's a unique economy filled with avid collectors, product-flippers, scam artists, thieves, automated bots and entrepreneurs that seek to cash inon a market with massive demand and potentially high returns. Across the country, these coveted sneaker drops often trigger fervent, relentless traffic to countless retail outlets and computer screens, where enthusiasts lie in wait for the shoe bounty to arrive. It's all very much in keeping with what one particular sneaker zealot told CNBC last year was a ""culture"" — one that comes with its fair share of drawbacks. ""I don't want to speak on behalf of all sneaker heads, but I think a lot of it is appreciation for the shoe,"" Sam Sheffer, a 26-year-old creative producer for Mashable, said. ""The shoes looks cool, and they look good on feet, and it feels good having a collection of dead stock shoes."" Looking cool comes at a substantial cost, however, as many top line products like Air Jordans, Kanye West's ""Yeezy Boost"" imprint and others retail for hundreds of dollars. On the secondary market, the value of those shoes tend to get inflated — sometimes by as much as four or five figures, depending on the year or the model of the sneaker. In pursuit of their passion, hardcore collectors like Sheffer operate surreptitiously in the cover of night, crouched in front of laptops and mobile devices — not unlike computer hackers. As it happens, they sometimes spend thousands of dollars, and countless hours, for shoes that may never even see the light of day. ""I have 25 pairs of shoes that I've never even put on my feet,"" Sheffer told CNBC. ""Those I bought for the intention of just holding onto, but if I ever one day want to [show off], I have 25 pairs of fresh kicks to choose from — or, in 15 years, if I need a couple thousand dollars, I can flip them easily.""  'It's a real thing' Still, being a sneaker chaser comes with more than its fair share of drawbacks. The culture thrives in the face of a rash of scams, robberies and violence that often provoke hard questions about whether materialism has run amok. Violence and tragedy have overshadowed the sneaker market for decades, at least since 1989, when Maryland ninth-grader Michael Eugene Thomas was shot and killed for his iconic Jordan sneakers. The incident would be profiled in Sports Illustrated's 1990 May issue, with the now infamous phrase, ""Your Sneakers or Your Life,"" across the cover. Five years ago, Nike announcement of a limited release of its $220 Air Foamposite One ""Galaxy"" shoe was enough to trigger riots at a mall in Orlando, where the NBA hosted that year's All-Star weekend. A pair of the sneakers subsequently appeared on eBay, where bids skyrocketed as high as $70,000. The environment underscores the single-mindedness that possesses some of the most avid sneaker collectors. That obsessiveness is sometimes a virtue, but for some can easily cross the line into vice. ""It started to get to a point where I started getting there at two or three o'clock in the morning, outside waiting till 9 a.m., when the store opened,"" Mark Stevenson told CNBC recently. The 28 year old spent nearly a decade as a self-made kingpin of sneaker-dom, amassing 125 pairs worth tens of thousands of dollars in resale value. Currently, Stevenson's extensive shoe collection has been whittled down to a comparatively modest 90 pairs, an expression of how two separate events influenced his early retirement from the sneaker game. Arriving at 11 p.m. at a sneaker store the night before for the release of the Jordan ""Grape"" 5s a few years ago, Stevenson and a friend got caught in a heavy downpour. They both eventually scored some of the last pairs, but developed severe colds from the rain. Walking out of the store, Stevenson and his friend were each offered $600 for the now sold out $150 sneakers — an offer which his friend accepted. ""That was the moment where I was like 'What are you doing?'"" said Stevenson. ""It was a terrible experience, and honestly, I could have caught pneumonia just for a pair of sneakers."" The turning point came several months later when, in another queue for an impending sneaker drop at 7 a.m., Stevenson witnessed a fellow sneaker head get robbed. At that moment, one thought ran through his mind: ""It's not worth it."" Stevenson told CNBC, ""I can't do this anymore, knowing that there was a chance you could get robbed. It's a real thing, you see it on the TV and the news all the time, people get shot and robbed over sneakers."" However, Stevenson's epiphany is rare in a world where the competition to obtain new and rare sneaker drops remains as fierce as ever. Just last week, Nike announced a ""Vachetta Tan"" version of the Foamposites, a $300 sneaker timed for release in conjunction with the 2017 All-Star game. On the secondary market, prices are already as being quoted high as $550.","[Curry, James, Harden, player, flaunting, All, Star, themed, colorways, version, sneaker, court, New, Orleans, umbrella, big, name, shoe, sponsor, like, Nike, Under, Armour, Adidas, This, weekend, Nike, expected, release, retro, version, wildly, popular, Air, Jordan, line, named, basketball, legend, Michael, Star, themed, colorways, version, sneaker, court, New, Orleans, umbrella, big, name, shoe, sponsor, like, Nike, Under, Armour, Adidas, This, weekend, Nike, expected, release, retro, version, wildly, popular, Air, Jordan, line, named, basketball, legend, Michael, Jordan, The, sneaker, industry, exploded, full, version, wildly, popular, Air, Jordan, line, named, basketball, legend, Michael, Jordan, The, sneaker, industry, exploded, full, fledged, marketplace, colossus, like, ...]",0.0

DD,E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company,3:DuPont reports quarterly profit vs. year-earlier loss,"Tuesday, 24 Jan 2017 |  6:56  AM ET","  Chemicals and seeds producer DuPont said on Tuesday it expected its merger with Dow Chemical to close in the first half of the year, suggesting it will take longer than previously estimated to win approvals for the $130 billion deal.    Previously, the companies said they hoped to wrap up the transaction in the first quarter of 2017.    DuPont, which also reported a better-than-expected profit for the sixth straight quarter, said it continued to have constructive discussions with regulators in key jurisdictions.    This is at least the second time the two companies, which have been in talks with EU antitrust regulators to save their merger, have had to push back the expected completion period.   DuPont also said it expected its profit in the current quarter to fall 18 percent from a year earlier due to a charge of 15 cents per share related to the Dow deal.    Operating profit, which excludes one-time charges, is expected to rise about 8 percent, helped by cost cutting and increased seed deliveries.     Net income attributable to the company was $265 million, or 30 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of $253 million, or 29 cents per share, in the same quarter of 2015.    Excluding items, the company earned 51 cents per share, beating analysts' average estimate of 42 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

CBG,"CBRE Group, Inc.",2:Cramer Remix: The stock that lives and dies with the border tax,"Friday, 24 Feb 2017 |  7:16  PM ET","Warren Buffett taught Jim Cramer, and many other investors, that the stock market is made up of stocks and not completely tied to politics or the averages. That's why when the market pulled back from its remarkable run on Friday, Cramer wasn't calling for a top. Instead, he will be watching the moves that individual companies make next week. ""If individual companies report good numbers, they can buck the top calling trend provided the economy remains as strong as we have seen since the year began,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. With this in mind, he outlined the stocks and events he will be watching next week. One stock on his radar recently is Constellation Brands, which has been impacted by the possibility of President Trump's proposed border tax. However, Cramer clarified that it has a unique edge because the Mexican beers it imports, like Corona and Modelo, can't be made in the U.S. A Mexican beer made in Flint, Michigan isn't a Mexican beer.  While the retail cohort has been struggling recently, Jim Cramer slammed the vitamin retailers as being worse off than the rest of the group. Two of the largest publicly-traded players in the space are GNC Holdings and Vitamin Shoppe, which both initially roared higher after coming public, but have fallen dramatically in the past two years. ""We've got two very ugly train wrecks here,"" Cramer said. Initially, these two stocks were loved, as more people became obsessed with losing weight, doing cleanses and taking supplements. Vitamin Shoppe went public in 2009 and GNC in 2011 and for the first few years the stocks were solid growth stories. But by the time 2015 came along, the companies started to struggle as nothing they did seemed to work and business slowed. Shares of live entertainment company Live Nation fell 3 percent on Friday, but Cramer thinks this was merely because the stock has run up so much and investors were profit-taking after the gains. Live Nation owns 167 venues in seven countries, along with four of the five largest music festivals in North America. It also has an artist management business and owns Ticketmaster. After the company delivered a small top and bottom line beat with solid guidance, Cramer spoke with CEO Michael Rapino so said he is very proud of the results. ""We had a spectacular record year, and the best news is it looks sitting here in February like we are on to 2017 on another continual strong year,"" Rapino said. Back in December, Cramer introduced investors to CBRE Group as a way to play real estate without actually owning a real estate investment trust. REITs tend to become less attractive when the Fed raises interest rates because their high yield suddenly becomes competition to higher yielding bonds. CBRE is the world's leading purveyor of commercial real estate services. Not only does it own property, but it also helps real estate investors by providing outsourced leasing, sales, appraisal, development and property management services. Since Cramer's recommendation, CBRE has rallied more than 20 percent. The company has also made three acquisitions. Cramer spoke with CBRE's CEO Bob Sulentic, who said he expects President Trump's agenda to be healthy for the economy moving forward. ""The talk about tax rates getting better is helpful, the talk about infrastructure spending is helpful, lower regulation could be really good for a lot of our clients particularly financial institutions so we're hopeful that good things will happen,"" Sulentic said. Cramer envies the rich hedge fund managers that have the audacity to call a top in the market. They never need to be right because the worst case scenario is that they are early. ""Top calling, like loving, means never having to say you're sorry,"" he said. Somehow the top-caller's position or performance never are discussed when they are calling a top. After all, that would be rude for Cramer to say: ""I see this is your fifth top call during a period when the Dow Jones Average has gone from 18,000 to 20,000 … and I have read your investment letters for years and you have repeatedly said the market is dangerous and you were underexposed to the market each time, so are you still underexposed, or short?"" But that is exactly what Cramer thinks is the right thing to do. In the Lightning Round, Cramer gave his take on a few stocks from callers: Palo Alto Networks: ""After speaking with Chuck Robbins last week from Cisco, I started to get a little bit more nervous about Palo Alto Networks and the aggressive way that Chuck is coming on in cybersecurity. So let's just say, not as strong as I felt one time ago before I spoke with Chuck."" Tanger Factory Outlet: ""Almost 4 percent yield and I think that is still an experiential opportunity when you go to those. By the way, in good times and in bad times, bingo.""","[Rapino, said, proud, result, We, spectacular, record, news, look, sitting, February, like, continual, Rapino, said, Back, December, Cramer, introduced, investor, CBRE, Group, play, estate, actually, owning, estate, investment, trust, REITs, tend, attractive, Fed, raise, interest, rate, yield, suddenly, competition, higher, said, proud, result, We, spectacular, record, news, look, sitting, February, like, continual, Rapino, said, Back, December, Cramer, introduced, investor, CBRE, Group, play, estate, actually, owning, estate, investment, trust, REITs, tend, attractive, Fed, raise, interest, rate, yield, suddenly, competition, higher, yielding, Group, play, estate, actually, owning, estate, investment, trust, REITs, tend, attractive, Fed, raise, interest, rate, yield, suddenly, competition, higher, yielding, ...]",1.0

It's a chance for the industry to honor Silicon Valley's finest and poke fun at itself. This year, though, the Crunchies got political. Actress Chelsea Peretti hosted the evening, and in her opening act she called Uber CEO Travis Kalanick a villain, adding that he has ""a good head of hair, bad head of brains."" Kalanick has faced pressure from employees, drivers and customers for working with the new administration in light of the executive order on immigration. He stepped down last week from President Donald Trump's economic advisory council. Twilio CEO Jeff Lawson won the award for Founder of the Year and used his acceptance speech to encourage other entrepreneurs to take responsibility. ""We do a lot of hard stuff. We tackle hard problems. We plow through walls. That's what we do for a living,"" he said. ""And the current political climate requires us to do this and tackle some new problems like we never have before."" In accepting the Include award, gender equality advocate and angel investor Ellen Pao said Trump won ""because we didn't have the inclusive policies at the tech companies that are today's sources of news.""

The Trump inauguration sell-off is not here to stay,"Thursday, 19 Jan 2017 |  6:53  PM ET","  Jim Cramer is in favor of the stock market getting a sell-off out of its system this week, so investors can stop freaking out.    In fact, he is sick and tired of hearing investors say that president-elect Donald Trump will be so unpredictable that the stock market cannot trust him.     ""It is like they are saying get ready for four years of non-stop turbulence … I am more confident than that,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.    If earnings can still boost stocks and takeover rumors can drive them higher, then Cramer considers any pullback in the averages to create a buying opportunity.    Cramer blames Amazon for the success of Netflix and Tesla. In particular, it is why the short-sellers are losing billions of dollars every day on their bets against the two companies, he said.    ""They just don't understand the Amazon factor, meaning you may not see what is causing all the love for either company, that love is tangible and palpable,"" Cramer said.    It is also the reason why both stocks continue to break out to new levels that most didn't believe was possible.    ""Both Netflix and Tesla, like Amazon, require you to think outside the box of traditional fundamental analysis in order to accurately value their stocks,"" Cramer said.    So, blame the nontraditional love for Tesla and Netflix on Amazon. Cramer likes Amazon and Netflix, but remained cautious on Tesla. Just don't short these names, because that would be foolish in Cramer's book of rules.    Shares of DexCom surged 25 percent last Friday after the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services gave its latest device a favorable designation. Meaning, the government will soon offer Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement.    DexCom is the maker of continuous glucose monitoring systems that assist people with diabetes with reading blood sugar levels without having to prick their finger with a needle.    Cramer spoke with DexCom's CEO Kevin Sayer, who said he was also shocked at the news when he heard it.     ""I was at JPMorgan telling people 2018 at that conference, and so it's good to be wrong,"" Sayer said.    Since the election, Cramer has been dividing stocks into whether they are Trump stocks or non-Trump stocks. One stock that he thinks the market has misdiagnosed is PPG Industries, the specialty chemical company that makes proprietary glass, paints and coatings.    After Trump's victory, some investors worried that PPG could be under fire as a non-Trump stock because it purchased Mexican paint maker Comex for $2.3 billion just over two years ago. Cramer attributed this as the reason why the stock has lagged behind the other industrials post-election.    However, Cramer debunked those worries, as PPG has a localized manufacturing model—meaning, it makes goods in the same country that they sell them, including dozens of plans in the U.S. He spoke with PPG's chairman and CEO Mike McGarry, who said he is happy with the Comex business.    ""Our Comex business is a local business. We make paint local, we sell it local. We are also the largest painter of cars in Mexico and industrial products, and those stay in Mexico. And the ones that come in the U.S., if he [Trump] wants to change production around, we paint them in the U.S., too. So we are agnostic on where the cars are made,"" McGarry said.    In the Lightning Round, Cramer gave his take on various stocks from callers:    CVS Health Corp: ""CVS is a very good company, but you know what, it's bricks-and-mortar retail. My charitable trust owns Walgreens. We own it because of the combination of Rite Aid and Walgreens would be good. But otherwise we would not own it because brick-and-mortar retail is bearish.""    Cheniere Energy: ""The trade in Cheniere is over because the great Charif Souki, who got us in very low and then got us out very high is gone.

That should free up investors to trade some of the names on Cramer's radar next week. He outlined the stocks he will be watching:  Monday: Teva Pharmaceuticals, Noble Energy Teva: This stock is right up there with Valeant on Cramer's list, and he is worried about the company's balance sheet after it doubled down and paid $40 billion for Allergan's generic business at peak. Noble: This company could tip investors off on how oil stocks are really doing now that OPEC appears to be pretty serious about supply cuts. Tuesday: T-Mobile, Diamondback Energy T-Mobile: Cramer is willing to bet that CEO John Legere will deliver a strong quarter. He thinks the company can keep its momentum going without having to merge with another company. ""Be aware that there have been occasions where T-Mobile has reported a blowout quarter and the stock has sold off,"" Cramer said. Diamondback: With the fastest growth of any of the Texas oil plays, Cramer said this stock will work as a trade. Wednesday: PepsiCo, Applied Materials, CBS PepsiCo: Unlike Coca-Cola, which reported a quarter that wasn't very exciting, Cramer expects PepsiCo to shine because of its snack business. With PepsiCo playing the stay-at-home thesis that is sweeping the country, Cramer expects good things. Applied Materials: Cramer thinks it will deliver better-than-expected results, given how well the chip business is doing and how well Lam Research has done. CBS: This stock is always a crowd pleaser. Cramer expects CEO Les Moonves to have positive things to say about ratings, programs and distribution. Sometimes the stock responds negatively to positive news, but then turns right back up. Cramer anticipates it won't be different. Thursday: MGM Resorts, Zoetis MGM Resorts: With good news coming out of China on gambling and a surge in new casino gambling in Vegas, MGM could report great numbers that could send the stock above the $28 to $30 range finally. Zoetis: The humanization of pets theme has also driven stocks like Idexx Laboratories higher. Thus, this animal and livestock drug company could post better than expected numbers. Friday: Campbell Soup, Deere, VF Corp Campbell: This stock is a real conundrum for Cramer. Its last quarter was disappointing, but the stock has been climbing since, as if someone has taken a large position in the stock in order to influence management. ""The Dorrance family owns a big chunk of it, but the stock just acts too well for me to believe it's being propelled by itself,"" Cramer said. Deere: It might not even matter what Deere says on Friday. The industrial agriculture cohort continues to trade up, and Cramer says Deere could paint a better worldwide picture for investors. VF Corp: This stock has been absolutely horrendous, but it seems like it is trying to bottom. Cramer didn't have a case to own it other than management possibility announcing an acquisition or break-up.

""We're at the beginning of a long bear market in bonds that will last for who knows how long,"" he said in an interview with ""Closing Bell.""    While bank stocks have enjoyed a run up since President-elect Donald Trump won the election, Miller, who is chairman and chief investment officer at LMM, believes history shows there is probably more room to run.     That's because back in the 1950s, when there was a long bear market in bonds, the banks did really well and traded at market multiples, he explained.   Therefore, he thinks big banks are going to have a ""very nice several year run,"" especially if the yield curve shifts up.     One favorite name of his is OneMain, which he called the ""perfect Trump stock.""

GME,Gamestop Corporation,3:GameStop shares tumble 9 percent on slumping holiday sales,"Friday, 13 Jan 2017 | 11:33  AM ET","  GameStop shares tumbled 9 percent on Friday, after the video game and electronics retailer said sales in its established stores plunged 18.7 percent in November and December.    Plagued by heavy promotions, soft store traffic, and double-digit sales declines in hardware and video games, the chain's overall sales fell 16.4 percent to $2.5 billion.     Though trends improved in December, it was not enough to offset a 26.6 percent comparable-sales slide in November. That month's results were ""significantly impacted"" by weak sales of ""Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare"" and ""Titanfall 2,"" as well as ""aggressive console promotions"" on Thanksgiving and Black Friday.   Shares were trading at $22.51 in late morning.   ""We are disappointed with our overall results, but looking broadly, we did see continued growth in our non-physical gaming businesses,"" CEO Paul Raines said in a statement. ""We expect this category to approach 40 percent of our earnings in fiscal 2016.""    Indeed, as video game sales turn more digital, GameStop has been closing underperforming stores and diversifying its business model. That includes placing a bigger emphasis on collectible items and technology like Apple's iPhone. Both of those segments posted double-digit gains in the holiday period.     ""Long term, GameStop's diversification strategy is critically important,"" Robert W. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian told investors.    Following its weak holiday performance, GameStop lowered its fourth-quarter and full-year comparable sales projections. The company now expects same-store sales to decline between 16 percent and 18 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with its prior prediction of a 7 percent to 12 percent drop.     For the year, GameStop expects same-store sales to decline between 10 percent and 12 percent. That compares with the previous projection for a 6.5 percent to 9.5 percent decrease. However, the company reiterated its expectations for fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 earnings per share, due to a favorable tax rate. GameStop expects to earn between $2.23 and $2.38 a share in the fourth quarter, and $3.65 to $3.80 a share for the fiscal year.",[],0.0

Penney — The retailer reported adjusted quarterly profit of 64 cents per share, three cents a share above estimates. Revenue missed forecasts, however, and a comparable-store sales drop of 0.7 percent was wider than the consensus Thomson Reuters estimate of a 0.1 percent decline. Penney also announced plans to close up to 140 stores over the next few months, as well as two distribution centers. Foot Locker — The athletic footwear and apparel retailer earned an adjusted $1.37 per share for its latest quarter, five cents a share above estimates. Revenue matched forecasts. Same-store sales were up 5.0 percent, better than the consensus 4.6 percent increase estimate from Thomson Reuters. Foot Locker did say the retail environment for 2017 will be ""challenging."" Hilton Worldwide — The hotel operator announced a $1 billion stock repurchase program, and also said it was changing its corporate name to Hilton Inc. effective March 6. It will continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ""HLT"" ticker symbol. CoreCivic, Geo Group — Private prison stocks are getting a boost after the Trump administration rescinded an Obama administration order that had moved to phase out private prisons. Goldman Sachs — Goldman was downgraded to ""sell"" from ""hold"" at Berenberg, citing valuation. Berenberg said that all of Goldman's good news is already priced into the stock. Wendy's — Wendy's was upgraded to ""overweight"" from ""neutral"" at J.P. Morgan Securities, following a meeting with company management. J.P. Morgan said management appears to have complete command over its tactical strategy to achieve long-term goals. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise — The corporate hardware and software maker reported adjusted quarterly profit of 45 cents per share, one cent a share above estimates. Rvenue fell short of forecasts, however, and the company also cut its full-year profit forecast due to a stronger dollar and execution issues, among other factors. Nordstrom — Nordstrom beat estimates by 22 cents a share, with quarterly profit of $1.37 per share. The retailer's revenue was essentially in line with expectations. Nordstrom did give a weaker-than-expected full-year earnings outlook and predicted flat comparable-store sales. Gap Inc. — Gap reported in-line earnings, with adjusted quarterly profit of 51 cents per share. Revenue was slightly above estimates. Gap also said its efforts to turn around will bear fruit this year, with comparable-store sales likely to be up for the first time in three years. The company did give full-year earnings guidance that fell somewhat short of Street forecasts, however. CBOE Holdings – The exchange operator will be joining the S&amp;P 500 next week, swapping places with Pitney Bowes, which will move to the S&amp;P MidCap 400. Pearson – Pearson announced plans to further cut expenses and sell more assets. The education services provider's shares are getting a boost, however, on indications that balance sheet deterioration of the past few years has bottomed out. Royal Bank of Scotland – RBS posted a ninth straight annual loss, on expenses relating to past charges of misconduct as well as restructuring. RBS has not posted an annual profit since 2007, although the bank does say that streak should end this year. Baidu – Baidu posted a revenue decline for a second straight quarter, but the China-based search engine company forecast a rebound this year as it expands its revenue base outside its core search business. Alphabet – The Google parent's Waymo self-driving car unit filed a suit against ride-sharing service Uber, accusing Uber of stealing its sensor technology. Uber responded by saying it took the allegations seriously and would review the matter carefully. Intuit – Intuit issued a better-than-expected revenue outlook for the current quarter, after reporting a slower than usual start to the tax season earlier this year. Intuit is the maker of the best-selling TurboTax software. Herbalife – Herbalife issued a weaker-than-expected current-quarter and full-year outlook, with currency-related headwinds among the key factors weighing on the nutritional products maker's results. Capital One – Capital One revealed that its anti-money laundering practices are being investigated by federal regulators. That news came in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, although it had mentioned receiving subpoenas and requests for testimony in a filing in November.   Questions? Comments?

MMM,3M Company,7:Cramer Remix: Big news about an Apple supplier was obscured by the Trump inauguration,"Friday, 20 Jan 2017 |  7:19  PM ET","  Skyworks Solutions didn't just deliver a blowout quarter, it gave investors a road map to further blowouts, Jim Cramer said.    Apple supplier Skyworks was the market's biggest gainer on Friday, with shares skyrocketing 13 percent after reporting strong earnings and guidance.     ""There is now enough business involving mobile connectivity away from Apple and enough of a roadmap of the future toward 5G … that you can see why the stock soared,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.    It was music to analysts' ears when Skyworks management called the quarter ""growth and success outside our largest customer,"" and confirmed inventories are lean.    Cramer says America just swore in its first pure business president, Donald Trump—and it now marks a brave new world for investors.    While the possibility of a wave of post-inaugural selling of Trump-related stocks did cross Cramer's mind, he quickly realized that it likely won't happen. If Trump is true to his word, then investors could miss out on the potential gains.     Therefore, ringing the register here could be a mistake, he said.    ""You shouldn't take the President too literally when it comes to stock picking,"" Cramer said.    Cramer will also be using a new metric to evaluate companies. It all comes down to whether a stock is or isn't a Trump stock. Cramer expects Trump's agenda of deregulation, lower corporate taxes and repatriation of foreign assets to have a significant impact on the economy and stock market.   On the flipside, when Trump has a problem with a company, he's not afraid to Tweet what is on his mind—something that will put certain industries under fire.    ""You will feel a whole lot more comfortable owning the Trump stocks than the non-Trump variety,"" Cramer said.    However, political cross-currents could either mute or boost companies that report next week, Cramer said.    ""The...pro-business tripod are potent as we hit the heart of earnings season. But so are actual numbers. Be ready for real opportunities next week,"" Cramer said, referring to President Trump's platform of deregulation, repatriation of money overseas and lower corporate taxes. Cramer believes those elements will be good for the stock market in the long-run.    With this in mind, he outlined the stocks on his radar next week.    Tuesday: 3M, Lockheed Martin3M: Voted by Cramer as one of the stocks that could help the Dow reach 20,000, he recommended buying shares both before and after it reports.    Lockheed Martin: Cramer is interested in seeing if Lockheed will trim its forecast because of the price cut to the joint strike fighter, which was done to concede with Trump's wishes. If it doesn't guide down, Cramer said the stock could fly high.    In the Lightning Round, Cramer provided his take on a few stocks from callers:    Activision Blizzard: ""My favorite has always been Take-Two. I've been with Take-Two the whole way. It's got more mojo than Activision Blizzard, but I like Activision Blizzard.""    Array Biopharma: ""That is a speculative stock. You have got a chance right now to play with the house's money. Take off half, and you'll be a winner.""

COH,"Coach, Inc.",2:Coach CEO: Any border tax will lead to higher prices for the consumer,"Tuesday, 31 Jan 2017 |  6:39  PM ET","  Like many other sectors on Wall Street, retail is keeping its eyes peeled for specific details on a Republican-proposed border tax that would increase fees on goods retailers plan to import and sell from other countries.    For luxury retailers like Coach, who has a global presence and outsources its material internationally, it's hard to foresee the exact consequences from a border tax without specific guidelines.    ""It all depends what the taxes are and whether the cost of goods includes the raw materials or not as an example,"" Coach CEO Victor Luis told CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" on Tuesday. ""Our handbags are made in 18 countries across the world with a concentration in Asia. We're very dependent on leather, and approximately 50 percent or over 50 percent of our hides come from the U.S., so is that considered a border tax? There's a lot of variables.""   Luis said 40 percent of Coach's revenues are garnered outside of the U.S and nearly 7,000 of its 15,000 employees are located internationally.   And since the United States in general heavily consumes imports, Luis said he believes ""any"" border tax could lead to higher prices.     ""If we see this border adjustment in an economy where 70 percent of GDP is driven by consumption that is driven on imports, any border tax will lead to higher prices for the consumer,"" Luis said. ""That's just a reality that we'll have to face if it comes to that.""    Unlike other retailers like Under Armour or department stores, Coach reported a beat on earnings and revenue for its fourth quarter, with earnings of 75 cents per share on revenue of $1.322 billion while analysts expected earnings of 74 cents per share on revenue of $1.318 billion, according to Thomson Reuters consensus estimates.     Combined with a successful quarter and a ""very high gross margin,"" Luis said he believes the company doesn't fall in immediate danger of raising prices.   ""The performance comes in spite of the very intentional pullback that we have had in the department store channel where there is increasing competition and [it is] increasingly promotional,"" Luis said. ""We have a very high gross margin. We're not in a category that is perhaps a bit more restrained in passing on prices to consumers. That is an advantage that we have here.""","[keeping, eye, peeled, specific, detail, Republican, proposed, border, tax, increase, fee, good, retailer, plan, import, country, For, luxury, retailer, like, Coach, global, presence, outsources, material, internationally, hard, foresee, exact, consequence, border, tax, specific, guideline, It, depends, tax, cost, good, includes, outsources, material, internationally, hard, foresee, exact, consequence, border, tax, specific, guideline, It, depends, tax, cost, good, includes, raw, material, example, Coach, CEO, Victor, Luis, told, CNBC, Closing, Bell, Tuesday, Our, handbag, made, country, world, concentration, Asia, We, dependent, leather, approximately, Asia, We, dependent, leather, approximately, percent, percent, hide, come, U, S, considered, border, tax, There, lot, variable, Luis, said, percent, ...]",1.0

It's the same firm that placed Eric Schmidt at Google in 2001 when founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page needed ""adult supervision."" He stayed for a decade and now serves as Alphabet's executive chairman. Heidrick &amp; Struggles also worked with Microsoft on its CEO search that led to Satya Nadella. Since Nadella took the reins, Microsoft shares have climbed nearly 80 percent and hit new record highs. But finding a No. 2 at Uber may be the recruiting firm's biggest challenge yet, as the most valuable start-up in history is now engulfed in controversy. The job it's trying to fill is no small task either: They need a seasoned executive, preferably female, to turn around an alleged culture of rampant harassment and sexism. Moreover, that person has to work alongside the guy who once called his company ""Boob-er"" and was caught on a dashcam recording — just a month ago — bragging about a tough corporate culture and arguing with an Uber driver. A tall task perhaps — but one with a potentially large windfall for Heidrick &amp; Struggles. In the past, the recruiting firm has received equity as part of payment. Heidrick &amp; Struggles didn't immediately comment to CNBC whether equity was part of its deal with Uber. In 2004, payment for placing Schmidt with Google included warrants that allowed it to buy 1.19 million Google shares for 30 cents each (disclosed in a filing with the SEC). The firm said it earned nearly $130 million when it exercised those warrants after Google's IPO. While most in the investment community agree that Uber isn't looking to go public anytime soon, the company's latest round put the start-up's valuation at nearly $70 billion.

While environmentalists oppose the project, manufacturing and construction companies responded optimistically to the pipeline plans.     ""I think the president is doing exactly what he said he was going to do, and that is putting Americans back to work,"" David Seaton, CEO of Fluor, a Texas-based engineering and manufacturing company, told CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" on Tuesday. ""I think from a manufacturing perspective, when you break these projects down, whatever the value is, about 30 percent is going to be manufactured. And it's great that it's going to be manufactured in the United States.""   That 30 percent ratio includes materials for the pipelines, manufactured products and machines. While Seaton looks forward to more U.S. workers going back to work, the CEO acknowledged that dealing with technology may need to be included in the skill set.     ""I think in terms of capability, I would argue one point, and that is we don't do anything the way we did the old ways,"" Seaton said. ""There's new technologies and there's new capabilities. But there certainly is the capability existing in the United States to produce pipe material and other things that would be used in this pipeline. So I think it's just a matter of retooling the system for the capacities that's going to be required to actually put that pipe in the ground.""   However, despite possibly having to close the technology learning curve, Seaton remains optimistic for the future of manufacturing and providing jobs for U.S. workers.   ""I think the good part is we got a little bit of lead time in order to provide that training and those opportunities for people,"" Seaton said. ""I'm just excited that the United States is putting together policies that are going to put these people back to work.

MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,18:Ex-Microsoft CEO Ballmer: Tech protests over Trump's immigration ban conflating two separate issues,"Thursday,  9 Feb 2017 |  9:42  AM ET","The protests from Silicon Valley and other corners of Corporate America over President Donald Trump's temporary immigration ban is putting two unrelated issues together, said billionaire Steve Ballmer, former Microsoft CEO and the son of an immigrant. Three federal appeals court judges may decide as early as Thursday whether to reinstate Trump's executive order, which temporarily suspended travelers from seven mostly-Muslim countries from entering the U.S. Ballmer, appearing on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Thursday, sees the debate over the ban as conflating two separate issues. ""One issue is specifically to what should or shouldn't be the situation with respect to seven countries. I think that set of checks and balances is going on,"" Ballmer said. ""The other issue, which is mostly unrelated, is what should our immigration policy look like for high-skilled workers,"" who can be important for technology firms and other companies to fill specialized jobs? Ballmer said. ""I'm the son of an immigrant. I do believe there's value to having immigrants come into the country,"" said Ballmer, whose father was an immigrant from Switzerland.  ""And on the other side,"" he continued, ""I do believe it's important to have reasonably secure borders. And I'm glad that dialogue is playing out."" In the CNBC interview, Ballmer also said Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey should focus full-time on the ailing social media brand. Dorsey is also CEO of Square.

BA,Boeing Company (The),15:F-35 program head pressed on Trump call as fighter cost 'on track' to fall 15 percent,"Thursday, 16 Feb 2017 |  8:00  PM ET","The Pentagon's F-35 program head told a House Armed Services subcommittee on Thursday the price of the fighter is ""on track"" to reach as low as $80 million in 2019, which is lower than previously indicated. Lt. General Christopher Bogdan, the Defense Department's F-35 program executive officer, also confirmed in his testimony that he had a phone call with President Donald Trump days before the inauguration and Boeing's CEO was in the same room as Trump and overheard their conversation. Analysts say the call was somewhat surprising given Boeing's F-18 Super Hornet fighter jet is a competitor to Lockheed Martin's F-35 aircraft. ""That strikes me as unusual,"" Morningstar defense analyst Chris Higgins told CNBC. Even so, the analyst said conversations between acquisition officials and companies take place all the time. ""It depends what the content of the conversation was,"" he said. ""It's important to understand that the discussions … we had were all pre-decisional,"" said Bogdan. ""There were no decisions made during those conversations."" According to Bogdan, he and Trump had two separate phone conversations before the inauguration — Jan. 9 and Jan. 17 — that followed Bogdan and other military officers' December meeting with the president-elect at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. The calls were first reported by  Bloomberg. Talking to reporters after the hearing, Bogdan said Trump's call, which Boeing's CEO listened in on, ""was not inappropriate."" A Pentagon official told CNBC they had no additional comment. The Trump call when Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg was in the room took place Jan. 17, three days before Trump's inauguration. A Boeing spokesman emailed CNBC, saying the company had no comment about the call. Lockheed also declined comment on the presidential call. Thursday's hearing before the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces was scheduled to provide an update on the F-35 program. Bogdan's remarks about the Trump calls were in response to a comment from the chairman of the subcommittee,  Rep. Michael Turner (R-Ohio). ""There's been some media reports that the president has called you directly and that that's a break in the chain of command,"" he said. ""It is my belief that President-elect Trump at the time was attempting to gain more information about the F-35 and its affordability,"" Bogdan replied. ""Trying to get more information about the F-35's capabilities relative to the Super Hornet [made by Boeing]. And trying to get more information about the presidential aircraft replacement program."" The presidential aircraft replacement program is the government's plan to buy new Boeing 747 Air Force One jets. Bogdan maintained that the questions the president-elect asked later formed the foundation of the F-35 review ordered by Defense Secretary James Mattis. He explained that the secretary's order includes looking at both the ""affordability of the F-35 now and in the future"" as well as the ""complementary mix"" of the F-35C and F-18 on Navy carrier decks. Lockheed has been under pressure to reduce the costs of the F-35 aircraft, a program expected to cost more than $1 trillion over its life cycle, last estimated at about 53 years. The next-generation fighter is the Pentagon's most expensive program ever. There are three different variants of the F-35 fifth-generation fighter, the F-35A for the Air Force, the F-35B for the Marines and the F-35C for the Navy. The total U.S. military buy on the F-35 program is expected to reach 2,443 planes, and out of that 1,763 jets will be the Air Force variant. There also are foreign military partners participating in the acquisition program. When including the foreign sales, there will be around 3,000 F-35 aircraft. Lockheed has already delivered more than 200 F-35 planes. Earlier this month, Lockheed reached an agreement with the government for lot 10 of the F-35 fighter. The deal was for 90 F-35 aircraft, including the F-35A variant selling for $94.6 million apiece — a decline of 7.3 percent from the prior lot and the first time it was below the $100 million mark. ""We believe we are on track to continue to reduce the price of the F-35,"" said Bogdan. Specifically, he said in 2019 the F-35A variant will cost between $80 million and $85 million. If the $80 million price target is realized on the F-35A, that would represent about 15 percent savings on the plane when compared with the last production lot contract.  Higgins, the defense analyst, said there needs to be larger block buys to get the production costs down. ""They've been saying $85 million is kind of the target they're looking at for a fly-away cost on it,"" said Higgins. ""So it's a little lower than they've been talking about."" Bogdan said the military plans to increase production lots significantly as part of what he termed the ""largest ramp up in the program's history."" ""The government-industry team remains laser-focused on driving the cost of buying the F-35's down. We continue to see lot-over-lot price reductions."" Back in December, Trump tweeted about cost issues with the F-35 and added, ""I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet."" The F-18 is a fourth-generation fighter jet and doesn't have the advanced stealth capabilities found in the F-35 aircraft. The F-35 has been a controversial program and plagued by cost overruns and technical issues over the years. Last fall, the Air Force grounded around a dozen F-35 jets when it found faulty insulation in fuel tank lines.   Bogdan said the insulation issue was resolved. He added that aircraft deliveries are recovering and will be back on production schedule by this summer. Several other senior military officials testified that the U.S. military needs the F-35 more than ever. In testimony at Thursday's House hearing, Navy Rear Admiral DeWolfe Miller praised the F-35C's capabilities and said the fighter ""will form the backbone of the Navy air combat superiority for decades to come."" Miller contended that the F-35C ""provides unique capabilities that can't be matched by modernizing fourth-generation aircraft."" Specifically, he cited the Lockheed plane's stealth technology and advanced integrated systems that ""greatly enhances a carrier strike group's battle space awareness and survivability to prevail in a high-end conflict."" Similarly, Marine Corp Lt. General Jon Davis was effusive in his remarks about the F-35. He also said the Marine Corp needs the F-35 because of its aging fighter fleet in the field. Said Davis, ""I'm becoming increasingly convinced that we have a game-changer, a war winner on our hands. We can't get into those airplanes fast enough.""","[The, Pentagon, F, program, told, House, Armed, Services, subcommittee, Thursday, fighter, track, reach, previously, indicated, Lt, General, Christopher, Bogdan, Defense, previously, indicated, Lt, General, Christopher, Bogdan, Defense, Department, F, program, executive, officer, confirmed, testimony, phone, President, Donald, Trump, day, inauguration, Boeing, CEO, room, Trump, overheard, conversation, Analysts, say, somewhat, surprising, given, Boeing, F, Super, Hornet, fighter, jet, competitor, Lockheed, Martin, officer, confirmed, testimony, phone, President, Donald, Trump, day, inauguration, Boeing, CEO, room, Trump, overheard, conversation, Analysts, say, somewhat, surprising, given, Boeing, F, Super, Hornet, fighter, jet, competitor, Lockheed, Martin, F, aircraft, That, strike, unusual, Morningstar, defense, analyst, Chris, Higgins, told, ...]",1.0

Still, there are some discrepancies. In its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, Amazon added a new line item to its annual report: retail subscription services. The company said it generated $6.4 billion in revenue related to that item last year. Guggenheim Securities analyst Robert Drbul estimates that shakes out to about 65 million Prime members. Cowen &amp; Co. analyst John Blackledge calculated an even higher number of subscribers. His estimate pegs the Prime subscriber base at closer to 80 million globally. An Amazon spokeswoman declined to offer additional details. The precise number of Prime members is difficult to nail down given the different subscription options Amazon offers. In the U.S., Amazon charges $99 for an annual Prime membership, which gives subscribers free two-day shipping and access to other perks like its streaming services. Amazon also offers a monthly membership for $10.99 and Prime Video membership for $8.99 a month. The latest estimates from Consumer Intelligence Research partners assumes about 19 percent of Prime members have opted for a monthly payment plan. Prime has been successful not only in generating subscription renewals but getting shoppers to spend more with Amazon to get the most out of their perks.","[Amazon, historically, kept, number, Prime, subscriber, latest, K, filing, online, retailer, hinted, member, Still, discrepancy, In, filing, Securities, Exchange, Commission, Amazon, historically, kept, number, Prime, subscriber, latest, K, filing, online, retailer, hinted, member, Still, discrepancy, In, filing, Securities, Exchange, Commission, Amazon, added, line, item, report, retail, subscription, service, The, company, said, generated, revenue, related, item, Amazon, historically, kept, number, Prime, subscriber, latest, K, filing, online, retailer, hinted, member, Still, discrepancy, In, filing, Securities, Exchange, Commission, Amazon, added, line, item, report, retail, subscription, service, The, company, said, generated, revenue, related, item, Guggenheim, Securities, analyst, Robert, Drbul, member, Cowen, amp, Co, analyst, ...]",1.0

EGN,Energen Corporation,"1:Oil stocks are lagging, but analysts see a path to growth for some drillers","Thursday, 23 Feb 2017 |  4:43  PM ET","Energy stocks have been lagging the S&amp;P 500, but some analysts see a path to growth for some well-positioned U.S. drillers. The energy sector managed to rally about half a percent on Thursday, but it's still down about 6 percent this year. Meanwhile the S&amp;P 500 has gained about 5.5 percent this year. For some, the disparity comes down to the belief that oil prices will remain stuck in a narrow range as OPEC continues to cut output and U.S. drillers increase production. That will cap the recovery for oil stocks. But some independent exploration and production companies stand to reap bigger gains from the oil price recovery than integrated oil companies like Chevron and ExxonMobil and larger independents, said Timothy Rezvan, managing director of energy research at Mizuho Americas. The bigger players are less nimble and have committed to big shareholder payouts, he explained. ""The companies that are being rewarded here are the companies that have clear growth blueprints"" and access to the infrastructure, services and materials necessary to economically drill wells and deliver oil and gas to markets. That includes companies that were early movers in core oil producing regions, like the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico, where the cost of producing a barrel of oil is relatively low. New entrants to the Permian face challenges as the region grows crowded, Rezvan said. Some of the drillers Mizuho has buy ratings on established Permian players Diamondback Energy, which is roughly flat this year, and Energen, down 8.5 percent since the start of 2017. Investment bank Simmons &amp; Company counts Concho Resources among its favorite exploration and production companies. Shares of the Permian basin oil producer plunged after it reported earnings on Tuesday, but Simmons said high expectations overshadowed strong financial results and guidance for 2017. Simmons highlighted Concho's plans to boost oil production by 25 percent this year, stronger-than-expected cash flow and strong hedging, or insurance against falling crude prices. The stock is up 0.5 percent year to date, leading many of its peers. Among the larger exploration and production companies, Iberia Capital Partners considers Anadarko Petroleum an outperformer for its ""superior asset base"" and ""smoother growth ramp as the industry comes out of the down cycle."" The stock is down 5.4 percent this year, but Iberia thinks Anadarko's exploration efforts can generate long-term growth and its portfolio of oil and gas assets allows the company to lower development costs while increasing returns. Iberia is also cautious on new Permian players. The firm said investment in long-term projects ""continues to be under-appreciated by those that are too busy stampeding like lemmings into the Permian Basin.""","[Permian, face, challenge, region, grows, crowded, Rezvan, said, Some, drillers, Mizuho, buy, rating, established, Permian, player, Diamondback, Energy, roughly, flat, Energen, percent, start, Investment, bank, Simmons, amp, Company, Concho, Resources, favorite, exploration, production, company, Shares, Permian, basin, oil, producer, plunged]",0.0

The company's shares were up marginally at $107.15 in premarket tradingon Wednesday.  PepsiCo and other processed-food companies are investing heavily to develop products to meet the changing tastes of consumers, who are increasingly seeking healthier options. The company has said it now gets about 45 percent of its net revenue from ""guilt-free"" products — beverages that have fewer than 70 calories per 12 ounces and snacks that have lower amounts of salt and saturated fat. Net revenue in the North America beverages unit, the company's biggest business, rose 8 percent in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31. Volume sales in the unit rose 1 percent. The company also benefited from lower raw material costs as well as productivity gains from multi-year cost-cutting plans, which include closing plants, simplifying its organization and management structures and investing in manufacturing automation. However, net income attributable to PepsiCo fell to $1.40 billion, or 97 cents per share, in the quarter, from $1.72 billion, or $1.17 per share, a year earlier. The fall in net income was due to pension-related settlements and a debt redemption charge in the latest quarter and a tax benefit in the year-ago period, the company said. Excluding items, the company earned $1.20 per share. The company's net revenue rose 5 percent to $19.52 billion. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.16 per share on revenue of $19.51 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. PepsiCo also forecast 2017 adjusted earnings of $5.09 per share, missing the average analysts' estimate of $5.16.

RTRX,"Retrophin, Inc.","2:Accused fraudster Martin Shkreli's former lawyer, current co-defendant Evan Greebel blasts him as serial liar in bid for separate trials","Tuesday, 21 Feb 2017 |  2:41  PM ET","Accused securities scammer Martin Shkreli's co-defendant said Shkreli is a serial liar who ""is guilty of committing fraud"" — and is creating a media ""circus"" to distract jurors from the evidence against him. In scathing new court filings seeking to be tried separately from Shkreli, the former corporate lawyer for Shkreli's company claims the pharma bro's chronic lies included misleading his own business lawyers — and also said he used them as unwitting ""pawns"" in his ""fraudulent schemes."" In addition, Shkreli, 33, has a long-term pattern and practice of blaming others for his own misconduct, according to criminal defense lawyers for his co-defendant, Evan Greebel. Those lawyers go on to say that the ""bizarre, one-of-a-kind spectacle"" that Shkreli has created since his arrest — which includes trolling Hillary Clinton, journalists, women, celebrities and government officials — is an intentional effort to ""become more polarizing"" among the public and potential jurors for his trial so that he will win acquittal. ""Nothing has been able to stop — and nothing will be able to stop — Mr. Shkreli from trying to turn this trial into a circus as part of a deliberate strategy to obtain jury nullification rather than have the jury focus on and carefully consider the evidence,"" said the filing by Greebel's lawyers.  The term jury nullification refers to when jurors acquit a defendant even when they believe he is guilty of charged crimes. The sensational allegations are contained in documents filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York. The two men face an upcoming trial in that court on charges they conspired to loot a drug company that Shkreli founded, Retrophin, out of millions of dollars, in part to pay off investors that Shkreli was accused of defrauding at hedge funds that he ran. Shkreli's lawyer Benjamin Brafman also has filed a new motion to sever the trials, citing the dueling versions of reality offered by the two men. In that new motion, Brafman wrote that ""Martin Shkreli maintains his complete innocence."" ""The evidence will show that he did not defraud, steal, lie, or cheat anyone out of money, and that he devoted his best efforts to bringing value to his investors,"" Brafman wrote.  Brafman said that Greebel's argument about being misled by Shkreli is ""patently unfounded and flatly contradicted by the written communications between Shkreli and Greebel as well as other evidence."" Greebel's defense, according to Brafman, is ""unfortunate, disingenuous and unfounded."" Brafman told CNBC in a statement, ""We believe that it would be quite impossible for either Defendant to get a fair trial if tried together."" ""As for Greebel's efforts to try and distance himself from Martin's legal issues,‎ the fact is that Greebel and his firm billed Martin almost $10 million for legal advice during the very period in question,"" Brafman said in an email. ""If not giving him counsel, he should return the money!"" The accusations in the pending criminal case are unrelated to the controversy that first brought Shkreli national notoriety: his having hiked the price of an antiparasite drug by more than 5,000 percent after acquiring it for his other company, Turing Pharmaceuticals. Greebel is accused of two criminal counts: conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit securities fraud. Shkreli is accused of those counts, as well as six others. Shkreli has pleaded not guilty to the charges, as has Greebel.  Greebel's filing notes that the two men disagree about whether Greebel was Shkreli's lawyer — as Shkreli claims — or solely counsel for Retrophin, as Greebel says. Shkreli's criminal defense lawyers said they will, at trial, mount a so-called reliance on counsel defense. That means Shkreli will claim he is innocent because his alleged criminal actions were committed after his own civil lawyers told them they were legal.  In his filing for Shkreli, Brafman noted the large legal fees paid Evan Greebel and his law firm, and also says that Shkreli spoke and emailed with Greebel and other lawyers ""virtually every day, often dozens of times per day,"" on every topic facing Shkreli's business. The filing cited ""tens of thousands of emails"" between Shkreli and Greebel. ""Greebel provided legal advice and insight to Shkreli, which Shkreli followed faithfully,"" Brafman wrote. ""Because Shkreli relied closely on his experienced legal counsel and other attorneys at the firm, Shkreli has a valid 'reliance on counsel' defense."" In their own new legal filing, Greebel's lawyers argue that having him tried with Shkreli would seriously compromise his right to a fair trial, particularly since the two men ""have mutually antagonistic and irreconcilable defenses."" The filing said that because of those dueling defenses, ""there will be no realistic way for a jury to find both defendants not guilty."" ""We will be arguing to the jury that, among other things, Mr. Shkreli is guilty of committing fraud and that Mr. Greebel is not guilty of the charges against him,"" wrote Greebel's lawyer Reed Brodsky. In a related document, Brodsky wrote, ""United States v. Martin Shkreli and Evan Greebel is the quintessential case that requires severance."" ""We will present strong evidence that Mr. Shkreli repeatedly lied to, misled, and omitted material information from Mr. Greebel and other attorneys at Katten Muchin Rosenman,"" Brodsky wrote, reffering to Greebel's former law firm. ""Indeed, we will demonstrate that Mr. Greebel was an unknowing pawn in a fraud about which Mr. Greebel was unaware,"" Brodsky wrote. ""We will also demonstrate ... that Mr. Shkreli is seeking to have Mr. Greebel found responsible for his own misconduct in the same way that, over the years, he has repeatedly shifted the blame for himself to anyone and everyone around him."" The filing said that Greebel's lawyers will also argue that Shkreli told third-parties that he had obtained legal advice from Greebel and other lawyers at Katten Muchin when he actually had not received any such counsel.  The filing lists several examples of Shkreli allegedly lying, including one instance in which Shkreli told Greebel that a former Retrophin director was making an ""equity investment"" in the company, when in fact that man was making a loan to Retrophin. Brodsky also wrote that, ""If asked whether during the period from 2011 through 2014, how Mr. Greebel has come to learn that Mr. Shkreli lied to him, I anticipate that Mr. Greebel would answer that he discovered these lies from his review of documents produced in discovery in this case that he had never seen before prior to the charges filed against him."" The filing for Greebel's motion for severance notes that he comes ""from a long line of attorneys going back at least three generations, including his father and grandfather."" ""He is a family man, husband, and father of three young children,"" the filing said. ""The dichotomy between the charged codefendants is stark."" The filing said that Shkreli has a ""plan of creating chaos to distract the jury's attention away from the evidence and obtain jury nullification."" ""Unlike any other case that we have been able to identify in history, Mr. Shkreli has a stated plan — corroborated by his repeated post-arrest actions — to disrupt the criminal trial, instill confusion, taint the jury, and apparently seek jury nullification,"" court documents argue. Greebel's lawyers argue that because of Shkreli's notoriety, as well as his post-arrest actions and statements, ""Mr. Greebel will be deprived of his right to a fair trial."" Their filing argues that while Shkreli has an ""extraordinary amount of negative notoriety,"" Greebel ""has absolutely no notoriety."" The filing notes that Shkreli, in a Financial Times interview last November, admitted to having a plan ""to make the case 'more polarizing and popular' by creating a circus-like atmosphere and encouraging hostile publicity."" ""And he admitted that his goal is to create the same kind of chaos that surrounded the OJ Simpson, Casey Anthony and Sean 'P Diddy' [C]ombs trials to obtain an acquittal as the defendants did in those cases,"" the filing said.  The Financial Times quoted Shkreli as saying, ""I have this fringe theory that I've sort of stress-tested a little bit — the more polarizing and popular a case is, the more likely an acquittal,"" the filing noted.  After citing the Simpson, Anthony, and Combs' acquittals, Shkreli said, ""What's fascinating for all these cases? They were all widely seen to be guilty,"" the filing noted. Greebel's lawyers argued in their filing that ""as part of his calculated effort to become 'more polarizing,' Mr. Shkreli has engaged and continues to engage an almost-daily, if not hourly, basis in deeply offensive attacks on women, the media, public figures and government officials."" An attached exhibit, the filing noted, identifies about ""75 examples of news articles, social media reports and video and audio recordings"" that reflect ""Shkreli's ongoing and deliberate efforts since his arrest to spread hate and hostility."" The filing said that Shkreli's attacks ""on women have been extreme, hostile, and unrelenting."" Among them, the filing noted, is Shkreli saying on an online live-stream two days after his arrests that ""he would let pop star Taylor Swift listen to an unreleased Wu-Tang Clan album he owns 'in exchange for sexual favors.' "" Shkreli also tweeted on Election Day last fall that he was the ""new right-wing boyfriend"" of pop star Katy Perry after she tweeted that she was going to cry about the presidential election results. ""Most recently, Mr. Shkreli sexually harassed a married Teen Vogue writer, inviting her to attend the presidential inauguration with him and flooding his Twitter feed with engineered photographs of them together on which he emblazoned ' 'Till Death Do Us Part,' "" the filing said. Shkreli has also ""taunted Stephen Colbert with a homophobic slur,"" and taunted and heckled Hillary Clinton outside her daughter's home after she became ill at a Sept. 11 memorial event last year. In his own filings, Shkreli's lawyer Brafman painted a picture of Shkreli as a child of ""working-class Albanian parents,"" who was ""raised in a modest Brooklyn apartment."" While attending Hunter College High School, ""his brilliance and ambition were obvious,"" the filing said. The filing goes on to say that while working in a mail room of a hedge fund founded by CNBC's Jim Cramer ""[Shkreli] showed a knack for understanding biotech stocks,"" and had earlier ""taught himself the complex chemistry and biology necessary to learn why certain drugs are effective and why others fail.""","[Accused, security, scammer, Martin, Shkreli, defendant, said, Shkreli, serial, liar, guilty, committing, fraud, creating, medium, circus, distract, juror, evidence, In, scathing, court, filing, seeking, tried, separately, Shkreli, corporate, Shkreli, company, claim, pharma, bro, chronic, lie, included, misleading, business, lawyer, separately, Shkreli, corporate, Shkreli, company, claim, pharma, bro, chronic, lie, included, misleading, business, lawyer, said, used, unwitting, pawn, fraudulent, scheme, In, addition, Shkreli, term, pattern, practice, blaming, misconduct, according, criminal, defense, lawyer, defendant, Evan, Greebel, Those, lawyer, go, say, bizarre, document, filed, federal, court, Brooklyn, New, York, The, men, face, upcoming, trial, court, charge, conspired, loot, drug, company, Shkreli, founded, Retrophin, ...]",1.0

Revenue, however, beat forecasts, and comparable-store sales also increased more than expected. Wendy's announced a new $150 million stock buyback, as well, and raised its quarterly dividend to 7 cents per share from 6.5 cents. Time Inc. — The magazine publisher fell 3 cents a share short of estimates, with quarterly profit of 75 cents per share. Revenue missed expectations, as well. The company was hurt by a decline in ad sales, although digital ad revenue did increase substantially. Alexion Pharmaceuticals — The drugmaker earned an adjusted $1.26 per share for its latest quarter, a penny a share above estimates. Revenue fell short of Street forecasts, however, and the company gave a lower-than-expected 2017 earnings outlook as sales of its flagship blood disorder drug Soliris fall. Avon Products — The cosmetics maker fell 8 cents a share short of estimates, with adjusted quarterly profit of 1 cent per share. Revenue also missed estimates, as sales were lower in most of its global markets. GNC Holdings — The nutritional supplements retailer earned an adjusted 7 cents per share for its latest quarter, well short of the 36 cent a share consensus estimate. Revenue also missed, and GNC announced it was suspending its quarterly dividend. The company noted, however, that its results do not yet reflect the recent overhaul of its business model. Tempur Sealy — The mattress retailer came in 5 cents a share above estimates, with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.18 per share. Revenue also topped Street forecasts. The company said worldwide demand for its products is ""solid.""

With Honeywell and Raytheon recently hitting record highs and Boeing's leadership sending the Dow Jones industrial average past the 21,000 mark Wednesday, the defense sector has been on a tear, up 17 percent since November's election. The major catalyst for the sector in the past few months had been Trump's proposed commitment to increase defense spending, a point he reiterated in his speech to Congress on Tuesday night. Trump's call to move ahead with ""one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history"" is exactly what leads Mark Tepper, founder of Strategic Wealth Partners, to bank on more room to run for defense stocks, even from a fundamental standpoint. ""These stocks have finally grown into what was previously extended valuations,"" Tepper said Thursday on CNBC's ""Power Lunch."" ""While being far from cheap, rapid earnings growth in the future has really brought down those forward multiples to an acceptable level."" However, not everyone believes in another rally for defense stocks, including Dennis Davitt, partner at Harvest Volatility Management. ""There could be potential growth, there could be great volatility [and] it could sell off,"" he said Thursday on ""Power Lunch."" ""That's a place where you want to either buy [bearish options] to protect your position, or sell out of your position.""

GS,"Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (The)",22:The new 'Government Sachs' isn't Goldman Sachs,"Wednesday, 22 Feb 2017 |  9:04  AM ET","Veterans of Goldman Sachs may enjoy top billing in President Donald Trump's administration, but executives from one little-known bank could soon wield enormous influence over Wall Street. OneWest is a midsized lender with headquarters in Pasadena, California. It entered the national spotlight when Steven Mnuchinwas nominated to lead the Treasury Department. Mnuchin bought the bank, formerly known as IndyMac, from the federal government in 2009. Now, according to people familiar with the discussions, the Trump administration is considering two of his deputies to head key regulatory agencies: former OneWest general counsel Brian Brooks for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and former OneWest chief executive Joseph Otting for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Another person with ties to OneWest, Tom Vartanian, has also been floated to lead the OCC, according to a person close to the administration. Vartanian, a partner at the law firm Dechert, represented investors in the $1.6 billion deal to purchase OneWest. The three agencies — Treasury, OCC and CFPB — have broad authority to craft regulations that affect the nation's biggest banks and financial institutions, from running stress tests to setting mortgage lending standards. They were critical conduits for implementing sweeping reforms of the financial system following the 2008 crisis and will likely be an important channel for Trump to make good on his promise of rolling back those rules. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the positions. Discussions are still in early stages, according to those familiar with the talks, and it was unclear when final decisions would be made. The CFPB's current director, Richard Cordray, isn't slated to depart until next year, though some industry experts believe the White House may try to remove him before then. Comptroller Thomas Curry's term ends in April. ""It would be an honor to serve again in the government after 34 years in the private sector to help the president recalibrate the regulation of financial institutions and ensure that they remain absolutely safe and sound,"" Vartanian said. Trump has vowed to ""do a number"" on financial industry rules instituted under President Barack Obama, and replacing Cordray or Curry would be an important first step. Both had long careers in regulation and enforcement, while their potential replacements have worked primarily in the banking industry itself. ""Fairly quickly, you could start to have an effect on the way the agency administers its discretion within existing rules,"" said Oliver Ireland, a partner at Morrison Foerster. Brooks was a managing partner at O'Melveny &amp; Myers when he worked with Mnuchin on the purchase of OneWest. The bank was previously known as IndyMac, and Mnuchin bought the subprime mortgage lender from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. after IndyMac collapsed during the housing crisis. Brooks then joined OneWest as vice chairman and chief legal counsel and left shortly before the bank was sold to CIT Group in 2015. He is now executive vice president at Fannie Mae and oversees fair lending, marketing and communications. Otting was chief executive at OneWest and a visible defender of the bank during community protests accusing it of aggressively foreclosing on homeowners and during the bank's merger with CIT. However, Otting was fired after the acquisition occurred. Vartanian is a well-known figure within the financial industry, with a four-decade career that included stints at regulatory agencies but that has focused primarily on representing banks. He advised Bank of America on its purchase of the troubled mortgage lender Countrywide during the financial crisis and has written several books on banking regulation. The three men's ties to OneWest could pose obstacles to their confirmation. Though the heads of the CFPB and OCC are presidential appointees, they still require approval by the Senate. Democrats repeatedly attacked Mnuchin for his management of the embattled lender, labeling him the ""foreclosure king"" and highlighting personal stories of OneWest customers who lost their homes. The criticism was not enough to derail Mnuchin's confirmation, but Democrats are likely to deploy similar arguments against other OneWest nominees. They hope to highlight Trump's ties to the banking industry as evidence that he has broken campaign pledges to ""drain the swamp"" of special interests in Washington.""I have a hard time imagining Midwestern state swing voters will appreciate government by bankers,"" said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project. — Tune into CNBC at 7 a.m. ET on Thursday, Feb. 23, for a live interview with Steven Mnuchin","[Veterans, Goldman, Sachs, enjoy, top, billing, President, Donald, Trump, administration, executive, known, bank, wield, enormous, influence, Wall, Street, OneWest, midsized, lender, Veterans, Goldman, Sachs, enjoy, top, billing, President, Donald, Trump, administration, executive, known, bank, wield, enormous, influence, Wall, Street, OneWest, midsized, lender, headquarters, Comptroller, Currency, Another, tie, OneWest, Tom, Vartanian, floated, lead, OCC, according, administration, Vartanian, partner, firm, Dechert, represented, investor, purchase, OneWest, The, agency, Treasury, OCC, CFPB, broad, authority, regulation, affect, biggest, financial, institution, running, stress, test, setting, mortgage, lending, standard, They, lending, standard, They, critical, conduit, implementing, sweeping, reform, financial, system, following, crisis, likely, important, channel, Trump, make, ...]",1.0

Earlier, McDonald's said it is on track to refranchise 4,000 restaurants by the end of this year — a full year ahead of schedule. That will bring its global franchised percentage to about 93 percent. The company did release financial targets for 2019 and beyond: In the near term, McDonald's focus will be on four pillars: menu innovation, store renovations, digital ordering and delivery.

BXP,"Boston Properties, Inc.",1:Top S&P 500 CEOs weigh in on Trump's effect on business and the economy,"Saturday, 11 Feb 2017 |  5:12  PM ET"," Donald Trump has set the corporate world abuzz. Some companies fear his tweets. Others gleefully anticipate his proposed tax cuts. All of them, it seems, are anxiously waiting to see how the Trump Era affects their bottom lines. To find out about executives' fears and hopes, CNBC reviewed every instance where S&amp;P 500 executives mentioned Trump by name in this quarter's corporate earnings calls — the teleconferences where execs field questions from analysts or reporters. Here are nine especially revealing quotes: ""Several of us in our business were sitting within 30 feet of President Trump when he took his oath of office on the platform last Friday. We all believe, and I mean all of us, that the most overwhelmingly important event geopolitically for the next 50 years is liaison, a constructive liaison between the People's Republic of China and the United States of America. That truth is undeniable. That dynamic is unquestioned."" ""Basically, President Trump recognizes that the F-35 is a very large program, it's the largest program in the Department of Defense. He wants to make sure... that the American taxpayer is getting the lowest possible cost on the program. And we understand his concerns about affordability, we certainly share that ... And it's not about slashing our profit, it's not about our margins when we have those discussions, it's about how do we get the cost of the aircraft down today and in the future. ""Well, first of all, we've obviously been following the Trump administration closely in terms of what you're talking about on tax reform. And it looks like we're going to ... lower the top rate to somewhere around 20 percent, eliminate the deductibility of interest but also provide for immediate expensing of capital. Also provide for a territorial system which is really good news for us because, as you know, we've got about $6 billion in cash sitting overseas that we can bring back to the U.S. very cost-effectively."" ""President Trump's clearly very focused on enacting policies that will grow the U.S. economy and grow American jobs, and we're very supportive of that. So I'm encouraged by his engagement. His approach to engaging business, having an open dialogue, discussing the issues, finding solutions, finding ways to grow U.S. manufacturing jobs I think are all very positive. And that engagement is a productive approach. We welcome it. We've got a voice at the table."" ""President Trump's focus of enhancing the ability for manufacturing industries to thrive and produce jobs, well, that's AEP's service territory. His focus on a balanced portfolio of energy resources, including fossil fuels, that's also AEP's service territory. So as I said before the election, whether focused on the Clean Power Plan as in Hillary Clinton's proposals or President Trump's proposals, AEP should prosper..."" ""First, in an overall sense, I've been very pleased with the agenda that the Trump administration has. We have seen an avalanche of regulation over the last decade, and putting a much more balanced cost/benefit framework in place to assess the value of those regulations, freeing up infrastructure pipelines, all of that is quite positive for our business, for the country, job creation, and a lot of things. So that is very much a positive."" We are ""very encouraged by their discussion about a strong infrastructure bill. Both President Trump and (Democratic) Senator (Sherrod) Brown are speaking about something significant in the neighborhood of about $1 trillion dollars over the next 10 years. That has a significant impact on steel consumption."" I also think what's interesting for 2017 is ... some of the European elections that we're going to see in 2017. As you know, we get a tremendous amount of revenue coming out of Europe. And that is something that, with the elections coming up, I believe in Germany and France this year both, it could be another volatile situation. I'm not saying it's going to be the same as when President Trump was elected, but that's something that we could look at. So I think geopolitical volatility could be definitely in the mix...""

TIF,Tiffany & Co.,12:Trump Tower's shadow cost Tiffany 14% in key holiday sales at its Fifth Avenue flagship,"Tuesday, 17 Jan 2017 |  1:52  PM ET","  You can't choose your neighbors, and for luxury retailer Tiffany's  flagship location in New York, the next-door presence of Donald Trump severely dampened a key shopping season.    The blue-box jeweler on Tuesday reported a 14 percent decline in holiday sales at its Fifth Avenue store, citing ""post-election traffic disruption.""    The midtown property is a critical part of Tiffany's operations, accounting for over 10 percent of total company sales, according to a report by investment bank Jefferies Group.    The jewelry specialist also said total U.S. sales were $483 million over the holiday period, down 4 percent from the year-earlier period.     Trump Tower, where the president-elect lives and works, became a nexus of activity with the real estate mogul's Election Day upset, bringing a near-permanent media presence, security perimeter and dedicated New York Police Department patrols. The Tiffany flagship, itself a tourist icon, shares its southern wall with Trump Tower.    Tiffany spokesman Mark Aaron declined to comment to CNBC about sales and foot traffic at the flagship store. ""We're trying to focus on things within our control,"" he said.    In 2016, investment bank Jefferies Group said in a report that foreign tourists account for 40 percent of the store's sales. Tiffany's U.S. operations have suffered amid a strengthening dollar and weak demand from tourists and domestic customers, market research company Euromonitor International said in a 2016 report.     However, Jefferies' Randal J. Konik on Tuesday maintained his buy rating on the jeweler's stock price. The equity analyst said that while the decline is disappointing, it was ""nowhere near"" as dire as other analysts assumed. Konik said he expects ""a gradual improvement as time goes by.""     The investment bank had said in a November report that ""fears of a Fifth Avenue store slowdown are misguided,"" and that concerns over street protests would be transitory.    The word on Fifth Avenue echoes this optimism.     ""All the publicity about the marches and about the demonstrations brought more people into the shops,"" said Faith Hope Consolo of Douglas Elliman Real Estate. She said people who didn't know where Tiffany's flagship was located would certainly know where it is now because it's next-door neighbor is impossible to ignore. ""They could thank Trump for the free publicity, believe me.""

F,Ford Motor Company,"4:It's all engines go in Europe for Ford, says senior executive","Tuesday,  7 Mar 2017 |  2:10  AM ET","U.S. automaker Ford remains bullish on the European market even as consolidation looms with General Motors moving to sell its Opel/Vauxhall unit to France's PSA Group this week, marking an exit from the continent. The deal makes PSA Group Europe's second-ranked carmaker by sales, with a 16 percent market share, Reuters reported.  But a key Ford executive believes the European market will continue to see growth.  ""Last year we had record profitability (in Europe), with nearly 4 percent of operating margin,"" Jim Farley, executive vice president and president for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Ford Motor, told CNBC on the sidelines of the Geneva Motor Show.  ""This is still a key market globally for new technology roll-outs like electric cars and automated vehicles, and key for Ford's commercial vehicles,"" Farley said.  Ford debuted its next generation Fiesta ST at show, which Farley said boasts a 1.5 liter turbocharged three-cylinder engine.  Farley told CNBC that a diverse product mix has helped drive Ford's profitability in Europe, of which the performance car segment accounts for a large portion of sales.  But he admitted that the European business is not without headwinds, particularly with the U.K.'s impending split from the European Union and the accompanied currency volatility.  The senior executive emphasized that the automaker remains committed to its six percent operating margin target. He added that Ford is optimistic that the British government and the European Union will be able to negotiate zero tariffs for the auto industry as Brexit looms.

M,Macy's Inc,"17:Stage is set for sold retail sales growth, but border tax threatens outlook","Wednesday,  8 Feb 2017 | 12:36  PM ET","Retail sales in 2017 are expected to grow roughly in line with last year's 3.8 percent gain, as rising wages, lower unemployment and a solid housing market drive consumer confidence higher. However, with many tax and trade policies still up in the air under the Trump administration, consumers are expected to continue being methodical with their spending. The National Retail Federation on Wednesday projected that industry sales will grow between 3.7 and 4.2 percent this year, excluding automobiles, gasoline stations and restaurants. That's roughly in line with the 3.8 percent increase in 2016, as reported by the NRF. Online and other non-store sales are expected to increase between 8 percent and 12 percent. The organization's forecast does not include potential legislation that could come from Washington, D.C., including the controversial border adjustment tax. ""We think that consumers will remain thoughtful, circumspect, [and] even a bit hesitant to spend until they really have more certainty about the strength of the economy"" and government policies, NRF CEO Matt Shay said. Yet with the economy on more solid footing and consumer confidence near 15-year highs, he added there's ""great potential for this all to come together very positively."" The NRF's forecast comes as retailers are eyeing the potential impacts of a border adjustment tax, a GOP proposal that threatens to slap a 20 percent tax on goods they import and sell in the U.S. The industry has banded together to fight the tax, which they argue could wipe out their earnings and raise prices for consumers. A recent analysis by Ernst and Young, commissioned by the NRF, found that the proposal could cost the average American family $1,700 in the first year alone, as prices go up on everything from apparel to gasoline. Proponents of the tax counter that it would cause the value of the dollar to increase, and consumers therefore would not be left footing the bill. ""Our forecast represents a baseline for the year, but potential fiscal policy changes could impact consumers and the economy,"" NRF Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz said. ""It seems unlikely that businesses will notably increase investment until tax reform and trade policies are well-defined."" The NRF's forecast follows a tumultuous holiday season for many retailers. Though the trade organization said that sales increased 4 percent in November and December — topping its prediction of 3.6 percent growth — major retailers from Macy's to Under Armour reported disappointing results. Last February, the NRF predicted retail sales would increase 3.1 percent during the year. The trade group then raised its growth forecast to 3.4 percent in July, citing a better housing market, job growth, higher wages and a greater-than-expected lift in online sales.","[defined, The, NRF, forecast, follows, tumultuous, retailer, Though, trade, organization, said, increased, percent, November, December, topping, prediction, percent, growth, retailer, Macy, Under, Armour, reported, disappointing, result, Last, February, NRF, predicted, retail, increase, percent, The, trade, group, raised, growth, forecast, percent]",0.0

The retailer has also more than tripled its 30-day average volume of 1.7 million shares, with more than 9.1 million shares changing hands on Friday.The New York-based company posted adjusted quarterly earnings of $1.37 per share on revenue of $2.11 billion, up 5.3 percent year-over-year from $2.01 billion. This topped the earnings estimate of $1.32 per share, according to a consensus estimate of analysts by Thomson Reuters, while revenue matched expectations.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell about 35 points, with Goldman Sachs contributing the most losses. Apple, another Dow component, closed near its all-time high. The index had fallen about 75 points at session lows. The S&amp;P 500 ended just above breakeven, with real estate outperforming and financials falling 0.75 percent. The Nasdaq composite closed 0.15 percent higher at a record. Pressuring the financials sector were bank stocks, as the SPDR S&amp;P Bank ETF (KBE) and the Regional Banking ETF (KRE) dropped around 1 percent, posting a three-day losing streak. Bank stocks have been some of the best performers since President Donald Trump's election, as market participants bet on corporate tax cuts, deregulation and government spending. ""A deviation from that will be perceived as a negative,"" said Rob Bartenstein, CEO of Kestra Private Wealth Services. ""My overarching belief here is that this policy grind — where we shift from expectation to implementation — will bring some volatility into the market."" Recently, however, equities have mostly traded in a tight range, as market participants seek out more details regarding Trump's policies. ""It's almost like we're caught in a swamp. The market just can't seem to move one way or the other,"" said Ryan Detrick,  senior market strategist at LPL Financial. ""Earnings and economic news have been pretty good, ... but, at the same time, the market is looking at Washington out the corner of its eye."" He also noted the S&amp;P posted its 37th straight day without a 1 percent trading range. Investors also focused on oil prices, with crude futures for March delivery rising 0.33 percent to settle at $52.34 a barrel, with the Energy Information Administration reporting a 13.8 million barrels increase in oil inventories. The American Petroleum Institute said Tuesday that inventories rose by 14.2 million barrels the week of Feb. 3, sharply above the expected 2.5 million barrels increase. ""The resurgence of U.S shale amid the rising oil could undermine the efforts of OPEC and Non-OPEC members in mitigating the global oversupply consequently leaving oil prices vulnerable,"" said Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, in a note. ""There is a threat of the OPEC production cut deal falling apart in the future if U.S shale continues to pump incessantly."" WTI had traded about 1 percent lower shortly after the EIA's release before turning positive. ""We've had pretty steady oil prices for a while, but we've gotten some volatility recently,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. ""But in general, it doesn't become a drag or a benefit on the market as long as it stays in that $50-to-$55 range."" The S&amp;P energy sector led decliners Tuesday, capping gains in the overall stock market. The Dow and Nasdaq hit record highs Tuesday. ""At the same time, you're seeing capital being allocated into other areas of the market, such as metals,""  said Adam Sarhan, CEO of 50 Park Investments. Metals futures were all up more than 1 percent for the week. Gold futures for April delivery gained $3.40 to settle at $1,239.50 per ounce. ""I look at buying gold as buying stocks back in March of 2009,"" said Sarhan, noting valuations for the precious metal are stretched to the downside. There are no major economic data due Wednesday, but investors kept a close eye on earnings.  Allergan, GlaxoSmithKline, Time Warner and Alaska Air are among the major companies that reported earnings before the bell. Whole Foods, CenturyLink, Fiserv and Prudential Financial are all due to report after the market close. Dow component Walt Disney posted mixed quarterly results Tuesday after the close, as earnings per share topped analyst expectations while sales fell short. As of Wednesday morning, 64 percent of S&amp;P 500 companies had posted quarterly results, with 69 percent of those firms topping earnings estimates, while 52 percent have beaten sales expectations, according to data from The Earnings Scout. The U.S. dollar slipped against a basket of currencies, with the euro near $1.068 and the yen around 112. U.S. Treasurys held higher after a $23 billion auction of 10-year notes, which saw weak demand, with the benchmark 10-year note yield falling to 2.364 percent and the short-term two-year note holding near 1.161 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 35.95 points, or 0.18 percent, to close at 20,054.34, with JPMorgan Chase leading decliners and Nike the top riser. The S&amp;P 500 rose 1.59 points, or 0.07 percent, to end at 2,294.67, with utilities and real estate leading seven sectors higher and financials lagging. The Nasdaq composite gained 8.24 points, or 0.15 percent, to close at 5,682.45.

DVN,Devon Energy Corporation,2:Senate confirms Scott Pruitt as EPA administrator in mostly party-line vote,"Friday, 17 Feb 2017 |  1:19  PM ET","The Senate confirmed President Donald Trump's nominee, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, to lead the Environmental Protection Agency on Friday in a mostly party line vote. The confirmation vote came after contentious hearings during which Democratic lawmakers questioned Pruitt over his ties to fossil fuel companies, his multiple legal challenges to EPA regulations and his public statements questioning the science behind climate change. Senate Democrats boycotted a committee vote to move forward Pruitt's nomination earlier this month and stretched debate before the full Senate into the early hours of Friday. On Thursday evening, some Democrats again called for Pruitt's confirmation vote to be delayed after an Oklahoma judge ordered his office to turn over thousands of communications with fossil fuel companies to a watchdog group. But the nominee appeared to have the votes needed to win confirmation on Friday. Democrats Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, both from energy-producing states, voted with Republicans to confirm Pruitt. Just one GOP senator, Susan Collins of Maine, voted against Pruitt. The final vote was 52 to 46 in favor of confirmation. While Democrats and environmentalists bristled at Pruitt's nomination from the start, conservatives and the energy industry have welcomed his efforts to place more power over drilling and mining regulations in the hands of states. He set up a ""federalism unit"" at the office of the Oklahoma attorney general to ""combat unwarranted regulation and overreach by the federal government."" Pruitt is seen as an ideal candidate to execute Trump's promises to scale back the EPA's Obama-era initiatives. He has been a leading figure in a campaign by Republican attorneys general to sue government agencies over some of President Barack Obama's landmark achievements, including the Affordable Care Act and regulations to reduce the impacts of climate change. A Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times investigation found Pruitt's office in 2011 signed a letter criticizing environmental regulations that was drafted by lawyers for Devon Energy. During his confirmation hearing, Pruitt rejected the claim he acted on behalf of energy companies in suing the EPA more than a dozen times. He said the suits were in the interest of Oklahoma citizens given the role of energy in the state's economy. Trump plans to announce executive orders during Pruitt's swearing in at EPA headquarters, Reuters reported this week, citing sources who were briefed on the plans. Earlier in the week, Beltway newsletter Inside EPA reported the planned orders may impact the agency's work on climate change, citing an administration source. The president has vowed to cancel Obama's Climate Action Plan, a framework for reducing greenhouse gas pollution, and the Clean Power Plan, a rule limiting carbon emissions from power plants. He has also threatened to defund the Paris Agreement, an international accord aimed at reducing the impact of climate change. Trump promises to increase U.S. coal, natural gas and crude oil production, in part by making federal land more readily available to drillers and miners.","[climate, change, A, Pulitzer, Prize, winning, New, York, Times, investigation, found, Pruitt, office, signed, letter, criticizing, environmental, regulation, drafted, lawyer, Devon, Energy, During, confirmation, hearing, Pruitt, rejected, claim, acted, behalf, energy, company, suing, EPA, dozen, time, He, said, suit, interest, change, A, Pulitzer, Prize, winning, New, York, Times, investigation, found, Pruitt, office, signed, letter, criticizing, environmental, regulation, drafted, lawyer, Devon, Energy, During, confirmation, hearing, Pruitt, rejected, claim, acted, behalf, energy, company, suing, EPA, dozen, time, He, said, suit, interest, Oklahoma]",1.0

""Finding new cures and innovating for diseases that we've not been able to treat is hard business,"" Yumanity Therapeutics CEO Tony Coles said in an interview with ""Closing Bell.""    ""We've got a commitment and responsibility to find these cures, but they don't come cheap and the research certainly doesn't come cheap,"" he added.   Trump met with leading pharmaceutical CEOs at the White House on Tuesday, telling them, ""We have to get lower prices, we have to get even better innovation and I want you to move your companies back to the United States. I want you to manufacture in the United States.""  He also told them he wants to make it easier for pharmaceutical companies to win regulatory approval for their products.     ""You're going to get your prices either approved, or not approved,"" the president said. ""But it's going to be a quick process. It's not going to take 15 years.""    Coles, who is also the former CEO of Onyx, said while he has to see the details, he believes there are things Trump can do to make it easier for drugmakers to compete effectively in the U.S.     ""One of the things we need is regulatory reform and a real focus on the corporate tax rate and the ability to repatriate dollars. Each one of these are important sources for investment for our businesses,"" he said.     Despite talk about lowering prices and moving manufacturing to the U.S., the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF ended almost 3 percent higher on Tuesday.     That's because the uncertainty about what could happen with Trump's new policies has already been priced into the sector, said Michael Yee, biotech analyst at RBC Capital Markets.  Therefore, stocks rallied because ""it's not all that bad today,"" he pointed out.   ""We talked about innovation and we talked about speeding drugs to market and lower regulatory requirements and bureaucracy,"" he told ""Closing Bell.""

HAIN,"The Hain Celestial Group, Inc.",1:Hain Celestial investors hope Friday event yields clues about outlook amid accounting probe,"Thursday,  9 Mar 2017 |  4:44  PM ET","Natural products company Hain Celestial could ease investor skittishness about its outlook when it meets Friday with analysts at a major trade show in California. The embattled company's accounting probe remains unresolved after seven months of waiting and some sales trends in its business are weak too. Hain has missed filing financial results for three quarters and its stock price is down more than 30 percent in value since the accounting issues were first disclosed in August 2016. Hain CEO Irwin Simon is scheduled to meet with industry analysts Friday at the Natural Products Expo West show in Anaheim, California. The natural and organic products company is an exhibitor at the annual trade show and typically holds an investor gathering. ""This is the big show and all the customers are there,"" Mitchell Pinheiro, an analyst at Wunderlich Securities, told CNBC in an interview. But the analyst said the likelihood of management providing a major update on the accounting issue is slim at best since he believes it would be ""a distraction"" from the mostly product-focused event.  That said, he expects the meeting might provide ""some color"" about management's view of opportunities going forward and the overall industry. Such clarity maybe particularly helpful since the last time Hain reported financial results was back in May 2016. CNBC reached out the company for comment. Hain's accounting probe led the SEC to open an investigation. The Lake Success, New York-based company previously indicated that the agency issued a subpoena for documents. Hain also is the subject of class action lawsuits in connection with the accounting issues and stock decline. Analysts say there's a chance the Friday meeting could move the stock price. ""If there's a sense that U.S. business is really improving, that could move the stock higher,"" said the Wunderlich analyst. Yet he expects there's also a risk of the stock going lower if there's a sense the audit might take longer. He said he expects management will avoid going there. On Monday, Hain issued a press release disclosing it had received a letter from the Nasdaq Stock Market indicating that it still hasn't regained compliance with the exchange's listing rule requirement since it has failed to ""timely file"" reports with the SEC. Hain said it plans to request a hearing before the Nasdaq ""to present its plan for regaining compliance with the rule and request continued listing pending its return to compliance."" When Hain first disclosed the accounting issue, it said there was a review under way by an audit committee and indicated it has retained independent counsel to assist in that review. The audit review is believed to focus on the timing of revenue associated with distributor concessions. Susquehanna stock analyst Pablo Zuanic said in a report Thursday that uncertainties still lie ahead for the company and ""significant inherent risks,"" including a possible restatement of financial results due to the ongoing audit. That risk does ""warrant some form of 'options protection,'"" he said, although he added that ""we see value in the company franchise."" Zuanic expects Hain might benefit from ""major portfolio pruning"" and also cited a recent management change in the North America business as a positive development. Hain has a large stable of organic and natural products brands, including Celestial Seasonings, Earth's Best, Ella's Kitchen as well snacks sold under Terra and Garden of Eatin' brands. Besides food, the company also sells personal care products. In a research note this week, SunTrust analyst William Chappell said new Nielsen data shows slowing sales trends for Hain's top seven categories, which represent just over 70 percent of its total sales. He said the data shows the categories down 5.9 percent for the four-week period ended Feb. 25,  compared with a drop of 1.6 percent in prior month. Chappell singled out the salty snack business as one area that had been doing well previously. ""We are particularly concerned about the salty snack business, which had been a bright spot for over a year,"" he said. The category posted a 4.4 percent decline in the four-week period compared with the growth it enjoyed previously, Chappell added. ""Overall, we believe some of the company-wide weakness could be the result of ongoing SKU rationalization, something the company talked about doing about six months ago. We expect Hain to provide more clarity at Expo West later this week when it discusses new 2017 products,"" he said. Some consumer products companies have resorted to using SKU (or stock-keeping unit) rationalization inventory management techniques as a way to fine-tune product portfolios as well as enhance sales and profit growth.","[Natural, product, company, Hain, Celestial, ease, investor, skittishness, outlook, meet, Friday, analyst, trade, show, California, The, embattled, company, accounting, probe, remains, unresolved, month, Natural, product, company, Hain, Celestial, ease, investor, skittishness, outlook, meet, Friday, analyst, trade, show, California, The, embattled, company, accounting, probe, remains, unresolved, month, waiting, Natural, product, company, Hain, Celestial, ease, investor, skittishness, outlook, meet, Friday, analyst, trade, show, California, The, embattled, company, accounting, probe, remains, unresolved, month, waiting, trend, business, weak, Hain, missed, filing, financial, result, quarter, percent, value, skittishness, outlook, meet, Friday, analyst, trade, show, California, The, embattled, company, accounting, probe, remains, unresolved, month, waiting, trend, ...]",1.0

GPRO,"GoPro, Inc.","2:Why Snap could be an amazing growth story like Facebook, rather than stalling out like Twitter","Thursday,  2 Feb 2017 |  7:49  PM ET","Snapchat parent Snap filed to go public today. Will it fly or die? History doesn't give a clear answer. Until now, the social media category has been a tale of two companies, Facebook and Twitter. Their stories are very different. Facebook stock has shot up more than 240 percent since it went public in May 2012. Annual revenue and earnings per share have each grown by about sevenfold since then. Most important, people have been flocking to the service: about 1.86 billion people use Facebook every month, the company reported in its fourth-quarter earnings call. At the end of 2011, it was 845 million. The number ticks up every quarter.  Twitter has had a rougher time. Shares are down almost 60 percent from their market debut in November 2013. Revenue has about tripled since then, but the company has never turned a profit — it reported a net loss of $290 million for the first nine months of 2016 (it won't report fourth-quarter earnings until February 9).  Twitter has also slowed way down on user growth. In the first quarter of 2015, it had 302 million average monthly users. In the third quarter of 2016, that number had risen only to 317 million, according to earnings report stats compiled by Statista. In its filing on Thursday, Snap revealed some impressive revenue growth: it jumped almost sevenfold, from $58.7 million to $404 million, between 2015 and 2016. It also showed a pretty impressive chart of its daily active users by quarter. That number is growing at about 50 percent per year, and stood at 158 million in the fourth quarter.  Snap is also showing enormous losses — it lost more than $514 million last year, way more than Twitter was losing when it went public (Facebook was already profitable). Those losses are growing more slowly, on both a percentage and dollar basis, than its revenue, which is a good sign. But the only way it'll turn profitable is if revenue continues to expand a lot faster than its losses.  So growth is the key. Will Snap continue to grow like Facebook has? Or will it stall out at some point? That's what investors have to decide if they're going to make this bet. One thing to consider is what core functions each company serves, and what the demand has been for the previous products that served those functions.  Technology companies like to portray themselves as doing something completely new, but the universe of human needs and desires is pretty constant.  For instance, Google built the world's best research library. Amazon replaced a trip to the mall or the hardware store. The iPod replaced a Discman and a bunch of CDs. The iPhone, and the PC before it, replaced a bunch of different devices that performed single functions well, packaging them all together at one convenient and relatively cheaper place.  Pigeonholing Facebook as a ""social media"" company is kind of meaningless. Really, it's a communications company -- specifically a many-to-many communications company (unlike mass media, which is one-to-many). It's become one of the primary ways for nearly 2 billion people to talk to each other, share photos, discuss the daily news, and so on. Its addressable market is basically anybody who uses a phone. Or writes a letter.  Twitter fills a much smaller need. It's essentially a news company. It's tried to expand into more general entertainment with things like broadcasting live NFL games, but even that's sort of a news function — it's highlighting something that's important to a lot of people, right now. Although you can communicate with people through Twitter, most don't use it that way. They're simply watching the news roll by, then commenting on it. Like yelling at the TV. As a business, news has its peaks — especially in times of conflict or turmoil — but the addressable market is much smaller than it is for a communications business. Add up all the TV news watchers, newspaper subscribers, and so forth. That's how big Twitter could be. So if Facebook is a telephone and Twitter's the evening news, what's Snap? The company answers that right in the S-1:  Snap's a camera. At first blush, this doesn't look like a great business — standalone camera sales have dropped ever since smartphone cameras became good enough for most people, and action cameras like the GoPro haven't made up the difference.  But if you think about the function a camera serves for people, that's a lot more interesting. Basically, it's a way of capturing personal experiences so they can be relived again or shared with friends or the world. It's a mode of self-expression, and it can be as personal or commercial as the creator wants to make it. Like movies, or literature, or TV programs. Like any kind of visual art.  Just look at how core users are using Snapchat, competing to create ""snap streaks"" (consecutive days of usage), which they share with their friends. They're basically creating a long-running reality TV program of their own life.  If Snap is able to become a dominant form of personal expression like Facebook has become the dominant form of communications, that looks like a huge addressable market — basically everybody on Earth who has the means to use digital technology. There are a lot of other factors you also have to consider, like Snap's spending on stock-based compensation, fierce competition for advertising dollars from Facebook and Google, whether the company is managed properly so it can quickly enter new markets and creating new hit products. But to the basic question, ""Can Snap keep growing?"" the answer is a resounding ""Yes.""","[percent, market, debut, November, Revenue, tripled, company, turned, profit, reported, net, loss, month, report, earnings, February, Twitter, slowed, user, growth, In, average, user, In, number, risen, according, earnings, report, stats, compiled, Statista, In, filing, Thursday, Snap, revealed, impressive, revenue, growth, November, Revenue, tripled, company, turned, profit, reported, net, loss, month, report, earnings, February, Twitter, slowed, user, growth, In, average, user, In, number, risen, according, earnings, report, stats, compiled, Statista, In, filing, Thursday, Snap, revealed, impressive, revenue, growth, jumped, sevenfold, It, month, report, earnings, February, Twitter, slowed, user, growth, In, average, user, In, number, risen, according, earnings, report, stats, compiled, Statista, ...]",1.0
XOM,Exxon Mobil Corporation,36:Lack of investment heightens danger of an oil price shock: Crescent Petroleum CEO,"Tuesday, 17 Jan 2017 |  3:31  AM ET","Lack of investment in the oil industry has significantly heightened the risk of an oil price shock in the coming years, according to Crescent Petroleum's chief executive. Majid Jafar, CEO of the United Arab Emirates–based oil and natural gas producer, highlighted the perceived absence of investment in oil markets and predicted a volatile future for the commodity if this trend continues. ""The problem over the last year is no one has been investing enough in the upstream. ... [It has been this way] for three years in [a] row, which is unprecedented, and so there is a real risk a few years down the line of an oil price shock,"" he told CNBC on Tuesday in Davos, Switzerland.   ""I think the new U.S. administration is going to see energy diplomacy as part of the spectrum of international relations. Much more so with the secretary of state likely coming from the industry, I think it is going to be an interesting part of the discussion with Russia and the Middle East,"" he added.  President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for secretary of state, former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week to testify. Tillerson still requires congressional approval to be appointed. Under an accord reached in late 2016, OPEC and non-OPEC oil-producing nations such as Russia agreed to reduce global oversupply and cut oil production by 1.8 million barrels per day (b/d), initially for six months. Investors have remained skeptical since the deal was struck that oil producers would be able to adhere to their respective commitments in an effort to balance the markets. Jafar argued increased production in shale oil — even when prices are hovering around $55 a barrel — has supported his belief that prices would stay in the range of $45-60 a barrel for ""some time to come.""

F,Ford Motor Company,"9:With Trudeau in DC, Canada could be Trump's next tax target","Monday, 13 Feb 2017 | 12:13  PM ET","Protectionist trade policies that could damage Canada's economy were undoubtedly on the agenda when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau met with President Donald Trump on Monday.  Trump has suggested that the U.S. should renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, the 24-year-old deal that allows for easy passage of goods between the United States, Canada and Mexico. Any change in border tariffs with Canada could be a disaster for a country that depends on its southern neighbor for 75 percent of its exports. The U.S.-Canadian border sees nearly $660 billion in total trade every year, including goods like car parts, petroleum, wood and aluminum. Oil and vehicles are by far the two most important exports from Canada to the United States, accounting for more than 40 percent of movement across the border. Companies like GM, Fiat Chrysler, Ford, Honda and Toyota all have assembly plants in Canada. About $58 billion in cars and car parts came from Canada last year, compared with $74 billion from Mexico. While Mexican light vehicle production has exceeded Canadian production since 2008, both grew at a higher rate last year than production in the United States. ""While it is a well-publicized fact that Mexico's domestic consumption is less than 20 percent of the vehicles it manufactures, Mexico is not North America's only export powerhouse,"" according to a recent report by the Michigan-based Center for Automotive Research. ""Canada is even more dependent on exporting outside its own borders, with domestic consumption of just 12 percent of the vehicles it manufactures within its borders."" Changes to the fee-free exports could hit companies hard. About 80 percent of Toyotas produced in Canada are exported to the U.S., executives said in a recent earnings call. But the United States is still by far the biggest vehicle manufacturer of the three, according to data from the international car manufacturing organizations OICA. And U.S. producers have become reliant on a trade system that allows parts to pass over the border multiple times during assembly. That's why a list of exports from the U.S. to Canada doesn't look very different from the import list. Canada is also a major importer and exporter of crude oil. While Canada produces nearly 5 million barrels of crude a day, that oil is coming from western Canada and is difficult to transport to eastern Canadian markets, according to government reports. Still, Canada exports to the U.S. about three times as much fuels and oil as it imports. Both measures have taken a hit in the last year as oil prices have remained relatively low. Any import tax would likely increase gas prices in the U.S., but it could also move more investment into U.S. oil fields. Prices on other commodities, like natural gas, lumber and beef would also be expected to rise, at least in the short term. Changes to the trade agreement would likely affect smaller industries, too: Top import categories include breads, pastries and empty medicine capsules; chemical and mineral fertilizers; and tires. Canadian chocolatiers have been growing of late, increasing exports to the U.S. by more than 25 percent in the past two years. NAFTA has also provided the U.S. and Canada access to a larger pool of employees, including Canadians working in the U.S. on NAFTA visas. Overall, Canada is the third-largest exporter of goods to the United States, but it's America's largest export market. It depends on the U.S. for expensive manufactured items like those in the export chart above, and also for billions in agricultural goods like fresh fruit and vegetables, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative. Canadians invested about $261 billion in the United States in 2014 — up 11 percent from 2013. Foreign direct investment could suffer if new policies make the border more restrictive. U.S. companies that sell services in Canada could be affected as well, as American companies export far more services than Canadian firms sell in the U.S. Canada's proximity to the U.S. could help its economy in other ways, if the U.S. enacts other isolationist policies proposed by the Trump administration. Canadian cities are already lining up to be the next destination for tech firms looking to hire international workers who are no longer able to work in the U.S., for example.","[part, petroleum, aluminum, Oil, vehicle, far, important, export, Canada, United, States, accounting, percent, movement, border, Companies, like, GM, Fiat, Chrysler, Ford, Honda, Toyota, assembly, plant, Canada, About, car, car, part, came, Canada, compared, Mexico, While, Mexican, vehicle, production, exceeded, Canadian]",0.0

MSCI,MSCI Inc,1:MSCI head expresses concern on China capital controls,"Tuesday, 24 Jan 2017 |  6:26  PM ET","China's progress toward full inclusion of its stocks in global benchmarks could be halted if the world's second-largest economy cracks down further on people moving money out of the country, index provider MSCI's top executive said on Monday. In recent months China has been tightening its grip on individuals and businesses trying to move money out of the country in an effort to stabilize a faltering yuan, although it has sometimes denied the measures were an effort to impose new capital controls.  The yuan fell nearly 7 percent against the dollar last year, its biggest loss since 1994, under pressure from sluggish economic growth and a strong dollar. A decision last June by New York-based MSCI to welcome the onshore Chinese stocks called ""A shares"" into its MSCI Emerging Markets Index could usher in hundreds of billion of dollars from asset managers, pension funds and insurers.  ""If they reverse course and they restrict the 'out' door, then how can we?"" MSCI Chairman and Chief Executive Henry Fernandez told Reuters. ""It's going to be hard for the MSCI to put the A shares into the index because we will not be doing a good service to our clients.""   Fernandez said capital controls have not yet affected international investors but nonetheless are the biggest potential issue MSCI is monitoring in China. He spoke to Reuters on the sidelines of Inside ETFs, an industry conference in Florida.    Last June, MSCI declined to add the A shares to its global emerging markets benchmark index for the third year running, saying China had more to do to open up its market.    ""China has made a lot of progress,"" Fernandez said, citing the extension of a link between Shanghai and Hong Kong's international market to a $3 trillion market in Shenzhen. That makes it easier for international investors to access the Chinese stocks.    Consultations on the China A Shares inclusion likely will start gearing up after China celebrates its New Year later in  January, and some investors said they were optimistic.    ""They want money coming in and they're not going to do anything to keep people from coming in,"" said Brendan Ahern, chief investment officer at Krane Funds Advisors LLC in New York.

LMT,Lockheed Martin Corporation,2:Military leaders say US ability to deter nuclear threats could fizzle in future,"Wednesday,  8 Mar 2017 |  6:09  PM ET","North Korea's latest missile firing was a wake-up call for the U.S. military on several fronts, according to top military officers.  On Monday, North Korea fired four missiles that ended up falling into the ocean off Japan. The event showed the rogue nation may be getting closer to its goal of having a nuclear-armed ballistic missile capable of reaching the U.S. The development comes as the U.S. military is relying on an aging command and control system that helps military leaders obtain and process information in times of nuclear threats, such as enemies firing warheads. Moreover, there's an added risk since one of the early warning missile sensors used by the U.S. military is in space, which also is seen as increasingly vulnerable. ""We were up most of the night watching the North Korean launches of SCUDs [or missiles],"" U.S. Air Force Gen. John Hyten, commander of the U.S. Strategic Command said in testimony Wednesday before the House Armed Services Committee. Fortunately, the general said the early warning systems that are part of the nation's command and control of nuclear forces found that the latest North Korea missile firings ""did not present a threat to North America."" Yet, he said, the U.S. military is increasingly relying on an aging command and control system, which he called ""my biggest concern when I look out towards the future."" The U.S. military this week started deploying the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (or THAAD) anti-missile system in South Korea in response to missile threats from North Korea. THAAD, which has already been used in other regions of the world, is manufactured by Lockheed Martin. Wednesday's hearing, entitled ""Military Assessment of Nuclear Deterrence Requirements,"" focused on current global threats including efforts to modernize the nation's nuclear arsenal and nuclear command and control capabilities. Hyten told the congressional panel that the nuclear command and control area is his ""number one priority inside the modernization piece. Everything we have today works very effectively. But it is very resilient, robust and ancient. Ancient is the concern."" Similarly, outside experts recently told CNBC more focus should be placed on command and control systems, including satellite and other communication systems with nuclear forces as well as how the military gets early warnings of an incoming strike. The U.S. military uses what's known as an Integrated Tactical Warning/Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) system, which includes missile warning radars and space-based sensors that provide a picture of threats. The information comes into the nation's command and control, thereby giving the president, the Defense secretary and military leaders key information when deciding how to respond to threats. However, experts speaking at the Wednesday panel said the space-based portion of the early warning and attack assessment system maybe vulnerable. House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, asked the military leaders about reports that other nations are trying to deny the U.S. the capability to operate in space and from space, which the congressman indicated has ""implications for our strategic deterrence."" ""When you look at what adversaries are doing, they are clearly building capabilities to deny us [capability to operate from space],' said Hyten. ""Some of those capabilities could go after our strategic early warning systems."" By going after space assets, it could potentially deny the U.S. visibility into actions of adversaries such as preparing to launch missiles or the actual launch of weapons. China is believed to be one nation increasing its research and development spending in this area although there are others. Rival nations ""should know we are watching very, very closely and we are developing capabilities to allow us to continue to fight through and respond to any attack that would come into the space domain now or into the future,"" Hyten said. Air Force Gen. Paul Selva, vice chairman of the Joints Chiefs of Staff, testified that enemies launching strikes against U.S. space assets also are creating ""ambiguity that's not helpful in terms of nuclear deterrence on both sides of the equation."" Elsewhere, the hearing also touched on the disparity between the U.S. and Russia in terms of non-strategic nuclear weapons. Military leaders pointed out that for the past two decades U.S. policy has called for the reduction of nuclear weapons and forces; however, in this same period of time they said nuclear rivals have not followed the U.S. example. According to Selva, adversary nations have instead increased their reliance on nuclear weapons, improving their capabilities and in some instances expanding their nuclear stockpiles. The U.S. military leaders were asked about the size of the Russian arsenal. ""The Russian numbers are huge and our numbers are small,"" responded Hyten. When asked about U.S. modernization of weapons versus others, Hyten responded: ""I don't have a detailed insight into the nuclear weapon modernization in Russia or China, but I can tell you that they are across the nuclear enterprise ahead of us in some areas of modernization, behind in other areas. In general, we can still provide the effective strategic deterrent we have to in this nation, but we have to step forward quickly in the modernization realm here."" Selva said the U.S. has preserved its nuclear deterrent by extending the lifespan of what he termed ""legacy nuclear forces and infrastructure,"" including sometimes for decades beyond what he said was originally intended. ""But these systems will not remain viable forever,"" he said. ""Nuclear modernization can no longer be deferred."" Indeed, Selva cautioned against any future disruption in nuclear modernization.  ""Any disruption in the current program of record for future acquisition plans will introduce the risk — a significant risk — to our deterrent,"" said Selva. The House hearing also provided updates for key programs involving the nation's nuclear triad, which includes land, sea and air elements. For example, the new B-21 long-range strike bomber under development by Northrop Grumman just finished preliminary design review, according to Air Force Gen. Stephen Wilson. ""It's making great progress,"" he testified. The B-21 stealth bomber will modernize the Air Force's aging bombers, including the B-52 built in the 1960s as well as the B-2, a stealth bomber made about 20 years ago by Northrop.

After more than a decade of stock underperformance, investors and analysts are ready for a turnaround — and the industrial heavyweight continues to promise one. ""We're forecasting 3-5 percent organic growth, 100 basis points improvement. Good backlog, good momentum,"" said Jeff Immelt, chief executive and chairman of GE, in a recent interview with CNBC's Jim Cramer. ""I like the way we're positioned in 2017."" The comment came on the heels of challenging questions about its recently disappointing quarterly performance. Immelt added, ""You're going through all the bears."" That may be true. But there are bears and perhaps for good reason. Right now, GE shares are poised to show a five-week decline. But looking farther back, since Immelt took the helm on Sept. 7, 2001, the stock has dramatically lagged the market. On a price basis, it's down more than 25 percent; factoring in accumulated dividends, the stock's up about 7 percent, according to Kensho. But the Dow Jones industrial average has more than doubled during that time. To be fair: that period was marked by a number of big financial and geopolitical events, including the 9/11 terrorist attacks (four days after Immelt became CEO) and the financial crisis, which directly impacted GE. Immelt acknowledged it. He also insisted that it's changing, that shares outperformed both the S&amp;P and the XLI Industrial ETF over the past two years, even the past five (presumably, factoring in dividends). That's because, as he points out, GE is a very different company than the one he inherited — one that no longer gleans more than half its profits from banking. That corporate makeover means 65 percent of the revenue the CEO inherited from his predecessor Jack Welch was divested. GE Capital was the biggest of those businesses it shed. The company siphoned off $197 billion worth of assets since announcing its financial services exit plan in April 2015, when Immelt unveiled plans to restructure GE as a pure-play industrial operation with a focus on tech. The plan attracted the interest of one very high-profile activist investor: Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund, which made a big $2.5 billion bet to amass a nearly one percent stake that same year. The firm declined to comment for this story, but in October, Peltz told CNBC the company has the ""best set of industrial assets on the planet"", shrugging off concerns of a disappointing third quarter at the time and expressed plans to stay with GE a ""long time.""  Immelt laid out a three-year timeline to pull off this massive corporate restructuring. Nearly two in, the results have been something of a mixed bag. The divestitures have fetched the prices expected and they've proceeded ahead of plan. In October the company said it would merge its hard-hit oil and gas unit, which has pressured earnings amid the energy downturn, with Baker Hughes to form the second largest oil field services firm in the world by revenue. Also, its hefty $321 billion order backlog represents 10 quarters of future revenue, and margins are expanding. Not to be overlooked: the dreaded ""sifi"" designation is gone, lifted by federal regulators in 2016 as the company offloaded assets. The ""systemically important financial institution"" label meant the company, with its banking and financial services business, was ""too big to fail,"" thus deserving of stricter regulatory oversight and tougher capital requirements. It's all promising, but other key metrics continue to elude the company. GE trimmed its guidance for 2016 in the fall, making mixed fourth-quarter results more disappointing. Wall Street continues to hone in on subpar free cash flow, which analysts say lags peers. Revenue has missed expectations 10 of the past 13 quarters — and actually, missed half the time since fourth quarter 2001. ""Everyone has magnifying glass on quality of earnings,"" says Deane Dray, a managing director at RBC Capital Markets. ""The more disclosure given, the more apparent there's more work to do."" ""If I was giving a report card to GE, maybe a C over the past 5 years,"" says John Eade, president and senior analyst at Argus Research. ""GE is pretty challenged by its size, it can be hard to move the needle on growth given its market cap."" Still, both have buy ratings on the stock. To be fair, the entire sector's emerging from an industrial recession — and analysts do say GE is poised to benefit from improving market conditions. The Alstom power business, acquired last year, is expected to become a profit power-house by 2018. Not to be overlooked, there also is its big bet on tech that's spurred clever TV commercials, led to the coining of he term ""industrial internet of things,"" and is expected to help shape the next generation of manufacturing, with technologies like 3-D printing and apps built on a software platform. ""Part of the change is the transformation to a digital industrial company,"" said Dray. ""It's all new. There's no blueprint that we can follow on how companies have done that, and it looks like they have head start."" GE said these orders are growing at a double-digit rate and it expects its Predix operating platform to pull in $4 billion in revenue by 2020. But that's still small potatoes compared to other business segments within the industrial giant. Nonetheless, it all speaks to the huge transformation underway for a 125-year old company with ties to Thomas Edison and a $260 billion market cap. And none of that factors in what pro-business President Donald Trump and his tax reform, regulation reform and infrastructure spending plans could ultimately mean for the global company, which is also a $20 billion net exporter. It shapes the likely final chapter in Immelt's long tenure, which is widely expected to come to a close by 2021, when the chief executive turns 65 and his time at the helm hits the two decade mark. ""We've laid out a plan to do aggressive cost take down. We've got strong organic growth. Between the buyback and the acquisitions, good boost to earnings per share,"" Immelt told CNBC. ""Our EPS last year was above the XLI. Our organic growth was above the XLI. So again, I like the way the company is positioned this year."" But the question investors are asking now: can he finally deliver, and in doing so, carve out a legacy he'll be willing to retire on. Time and a series of earnings reports will tell.","[General, Electric, midst, massive, transformation, clock, ticking, After, decade, underperformance, investor, analyst, turnaround, industrial, heavyweight, continues, promise, We, forecasting, percent, General, Electric, midst, massive, transformation, clock, ticking, After, decade, underperformance, investor, analyst, turnaround, industrial, heavyweight, continues, promise, We, forecasting, percent, organic, earnings, say, Deane, Dray, managing, director, RBC, Capital, Markets, The, disclosure, given, apparent, work, If, I, giving, report, GE, maybe, C, past, year, say, John, Eade, president, senior, analyst, Argus, Research, GE, pretty, challenged, size, hard, move, needle, growth, given]",1.0

PCG,Pacific Gas & Electric Co.,1:Northern California dam forced to use emergency spillway for first time as water tops capacity,"Saturday, 11 Feb 2017 |  2:56  PM ET","The emergency spillway at California's swollen Oroville Dam was activated Saturday, as water levels from heavy rains this week caused the reservoir to rise above its capacity during an unusually plentiful rain season. Saturday marked the first time the emergency spillway has been used in the dam's 48-year history. Normally the dam would use its concrete-lined spillway to discharge water, but that primary channel is severely damaged. However, utilizing the emergency spillway—essentially an unlined hillside—is likely to send mud and other debris into the water of rivers and channels downstream.   The California Department of Water Resources said in a release that the ""the volume of water is expected to pose no flood threat downstream, and should remain well within the capacity of Feather River and other channels to handle."" Even so, the state agency cautioned that ""the rate of flow into the ungated emergency spillway may change quickly."" The use of the emergency spillway follows a series of so-called atmospheric river storms that have dropped huge amounts of rain into Northern California—a region tracking to have its wettest year ever recorded. The mountains surrounding the Oroville Dam received between 10 and 20 inches of rain from Wednesday to Friday, according to the National Weather Service in Sacramento. The dam is located in the foothills of the western Sierra Nevada mountain range. ""This is tracking to be perhaps the wettest season in Northern California ever,"" DWR spokesman Doug Carlson said Friday. According to Carlson, the Northern California region as of Friday was at 228 percent of normal for this time year. This year's wet season, which began on October 1, is on track to be wetter than the 1982-83 season, which was the wettest. Oroville Dam, the state's second-largest reservoir, suffered damage to its primary concrete-lined spillway due to erosion. The primary spillway was designed to divert rising water out of the dam, but damage to the channel was discovered Tuesday just as major storms were approaching. ""Oroville Dam itself remains safe, and there is no imminent threat to the public,"" DWR said Saturday. ""DWR is coordinating closely with state and federal wildlife and dam safety officials at Oroville Dam."" The average annual rainfall in Northern California is 50 inches, based on data the state tracks going back to the 1920s. As of Saturday morning, the region was tracking at 68 inches of precipitation and trending higher than 1982-83 when the wet season produced a whopping 88.5 inches. Late Friday, California Gov. Jerry Brown announced that he requested a presidential disaster declaration for the state. It comes after a series of damaging storms in January ""that caused flooding, mudslides, erosion, power outages and damage to critical infrastructure across California."" In a letter to President Donald Trump, Brown said ""preliminary assessments indicate the most severe impacts were to public infrastructure, including roads and bridges, flood and water control structures, and other public facilities."" At a press briefing Saturday, state officials estimated it could cost between $100 million and $200 million to repair the damaged Oroville Dam spillway. A DWR spokesman said later there's also a possibility they may decide to build an entirely new spillway at the dam.  The failure of the concrete base at Oroville Dam's primary spillway has put the spotlight on the state's aging infrastructure at a time when Trump is talking about increasing U.S. spending on infrastructure. Oroville Dam was dedicated in the late 1960s when Ronald Reagan was the state's governor. Inflows into the Oroville reservoir—located about 70 miles north of Sacramento—were rising faster than outflows late Thursday as the storm system brought heavy rain to the Oroville area. And Friday it appeared the inflows were moderating from earlier levels. Indeed, state officials Friday at a press conference indicated they were unlikely to use the emergency spillway since the damaged primary channel still was able to release sufficient water levels. Yet, things changed by Saturday as more water continued to flow into the reservoir as a result of the heavy rains. The state began preparations Thursday to use the emergency spillway. The auxiliary outlet is designed to kick in automatically if Oroville—the nation's tallest dam—reaches the 901 feet elevation. As of 11pm on Friday the elevation stood at 899.16 feet according to the state's website. By Saturday morning at 7am the level was at 900.89 feet and rising, according to the DWR data website. The emergency spillway was always considered a backstop option if the existing 3,000-foot-long spillway could not be utilized for outflows. Engineers were able to use the damaged spillway to a limited extent although water releases into damaged spillway caused further erosion of the channel. The erosion to the Oroville Dam spillway was originally estimated to be a 200-foot-long strip, and about 30-foot depth. But by Friday the length of the erosion had grown by at least 50 percent due to more concrete crumbling. Ahead of possible use of the emergency spillway, there were frantic efforts over the last few days, as teams worked to prepare the hillside for a deluge of water. Heavy earth-moving equipment was brought in and there were helicopters assisting with efforts on the ground. Cal Fire crews cleared a hillside area near the dam's emergency spillway of trees, rocks and other debris to reduce potential debris flows downstream. Crews from the local power company, PG&amp;E, removed several electrical lines using crews carried by helicopters and there also were plans to move transmission towers from the path of the emergency spillway. Also, the state's Department of Fish and Wildlife on Thursday began to evacuate fish from a hatchery located downstream.","[cleared, hillside, area, near, dam, emergency, spillway, tree, rock, debris, reduce, potential, debris, flow, downstream, Crews, local, company, PG, amp, E, removed, electrical, line, using, carried, helicopter, plan, move, transmission, tower, path, emergency, spillway, Also, state, Department, Fish, Wildlife, Thursday]",0.0

MMP,Magellan Midstream Partners L.P.,"3:Cramer's charts predict a murky future for crude, despite Trump's pro-energy stance","Tuesday, 24 Jan 2017 |  6:28  PM ET","President Trump attempted to fast track the Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines on Tuesday, proving to Jim Cramer that this will be the most pro-petroleum administration in American history.    However, that doesn't mean the price of oil is about to skyrocket.    ""While the oil producers will definitely benefit from deregulation and the approval of new pipelines, the actual outlook for the price of oil is more murky,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.    To gain further insight, Cramer turned to Carley Garner, a technician and commodities expert. She is also the founder of DeCarley Trading and is a colleague of Cramer's at RealMoney.com.    The first element Garner took into account is the seasonality of oil. Typically oil strengthens from the later part of the first quarter into the end of the third quarter. However, given that oil prices are already elevated, Garner doesn't trust seasonal patterns right now.     For seasonal patterns to be relevant, the price of crude would need to be hit hard in the next few weeks.    The next factors she considered were: Was who owns oil right now, and is it in weak or strong hands. According to the Commodity Futures Trading commission's Commitment of Traders Report, oil future speculators currently have the largest net-long position since the price of crude started crashing in June, 2014.    The last time big traders and investors were this bullish on crude, the price of oil crashed 60 percent over the following six months. With so many bulls right now, Garner thinks it could be difficult for crude to have much more upside.    The weekly chart of West Texas Crude was also filled with mixed signals. Garner found a ceiling of resistance for oil at $56 a barrel, and if it breaks above that level she thinks it could run up to $63. On the flipside, she found a floor of support at $46 and if it breaks below that level, crude could plunge to $40.    With all of these technical signals in play, Garner found the price of oil to be very murky. She said there is a fifty-fifty proposition on whether oil goes higher or lower at current levels.   Ultimately, Cramer likes oil stocks in this environment, but warned that investors need to believe they can do well, even if crude stalls out. His top pick was Magellan Midstream Partners.    ""This is still one more reason why I think the pipelines are the best way to play the oil patch,"" Cramer said.    Questions for Cramer?

LOW,"Lowe's Companies, Inc.",1:More homeowners cashing in on their new housing wealth,"Friday,  3 Mar 2017 | 10:55  AM ET","Homeowners are opening their favorite piggy bank again — their homes. As home values rise faster than expected, that increased homeowner wealth suddenly seems more enticing. It's showing up in big remodeling growth and higher profits for retailers like Home Depot and Lowe's, but it also serves as a warning sign. Ever since the epic housing crash at the end of the last decade, homeowners have been extremely conservative with their home equity. Even those who had money in their homes kept it there, fearing another downturn in prices. Now, as millions of borrowers come up from underwater on their home loans and many more see their home values jump sizably on paper, borrowing more is back in favor. Home equity lines of credit, known as HELOCs and often serving as second loans, allow homeowners to pull cash out of their homes when they need it. HELOC volume is now up 21 percent in the past two years, to the highest level since 2008, according to Moody's. It is still nowhere near its housing boom level, when many people treated their homes like ATMs, but the trajectory is definitely pointing higher. ""The more second liens that people take out, it adds a risk that comes from the rising home prices. The fact that people are leveraging their homes more than before makes things more risky,"" said Peter McNally, senior analyst at Moody's. Borrowers are also putting smaller down payments on home loans now, starting with less home equity either to save cash or because they can't afford anything more. To put it in perspective, before the last housing boom, the median down payment was just over 7 percent. It then dropped to 3 percent during the height of the boom, as lenders offered all kinds of ""creative"" loan products that required little to no down payment. After the crash, much of that lending became illegal and new rules made low down-payment loans more expensive to produce. As a result, down payments rose back above 7 percent again during the recovery. At the end of 2016, the median down payment had fallen to 6 percent, according to ATTOM Data Solutions, and it appears to be headed lower, as lenders offer more low down-payment products. One wrench in the run to grab equity is the fact that interest rates are rising. That makes loans more expensive and consequently takes the shine off low down-payment loans, which require added mortgage insurance. The fourth quarter of 2016 brought the first significantly higher mortgage rates in more than three years. ""Rising interest rates did seem to have a chilling effect on homebuyers using financing, as evidenced not only by the drop in purchase loan originations but also a corresponding rise in the share of cash buyers, drop in FHA buyer share and a rise in the average down-payment percentage in the fourth quarter compared to the previous quarter,"" said Daren Blomquist, vice president at ATTOM. Homeowners are clearly leaning toward more leverage, but they are doing so in a far different environment than in 2006. Mortgage underwriting is far stricter, especially for home equity loans, and borrowers must prove their ability to repay loans, including all financial documentation. Home equity continues to rise steadily, according to the Federal Reserve Board, and it is still rising faster than borrowers are withdrawing it. The caution comes amid a growing concern that home prices are overheating. Tight supply, rather than income growth, is pushing prices, and that is not a sustainable scenario. While it is unlikely that home prices will fall nationally, the gains will inevitably shrink, and some of the hottest markets could see sizable retreats, putting pressure once again on the amount of housing wealth. Correction: This story was revised to correct that McNally is with Moody's and that the study on home equity lines of credit was by that firm.","[value, rise, faster, expected, increased, homeowner, wealth, suddenly, enticing, It, showing, big, remodeling, growth, higher, profit, retailer, like, Home, Depot, Lowe, serf, warning, sign, Ever, epic, housing, crash, end, decade, homeowner, extremely, conservative, home, equity, Even, home, kept, fearing, downturn]",1.0
AMZN,"Amazon.com, Inc.",13:Cramer Remix: How drug stocks fulfilled their destiny without Trump,"Tuesday, 28 Feb 2017 |  7:21  PM ET","  Many investors assume that President Donald Trump's meeting with pharmaceutical executives back in January is behind the tremendous run that these stocks have had, but Jim Cramer pointed to something else. ""Let's recognize that some moves are simply related to bonds, and bonds aren't in the grips of the economy, they are being driven by this bizarre shortage of bonds from the developed world,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. Short sellers built up positions ahead of the meeting with Trump, betting that the stocks would go down afterward. After all, Trump had campaigned against outrageous sums that the U.S. government paid drug companies. But the drug companies came to the table with powerful statistics surrounding employment, and after the meeting Trump began praising the executives and moved on to the next group. But just because the group bottomed, doesn't mean that explains the rally. When Cramer studied the gains of Merck, Eli Lilly and Pfizer, he discovered that they simply rose because they were bond market equivalents. High-yielding dividend stocks followed bonds. As the bond prices rose and bond yields fell, investors crowded into them for income. Cramer witnessed the most violent contrast in earnings he has seen in ages on Tuesday when Domino's Pizza crushed estimates, while Target gave a forecast that was far worse than expected. These two stocks are a perfect metaphor for the current environment of the stock market, thanks to what Cramer calls the ""stay-at-home economy."" This refers to thriving stocks — such as Amazon, Netflix and Domino's — that allow people to stay at home and save money. Domino's delivers pizza and can be accessed from almost every device to order from home. Target requires people to leave the house and go to the store. Its prices aren't anything special, certainly not what they can get from Amazon, which delivers right to its customer's door for free if they are an Amazon Prime member. ""We have to question the entire relevance of Target, particularly if prices go up 20 to 25 percent … Three-year plan? How about a survival plan. There is no long-game anymore,"" Cramer said. As the market eagerly awaits the IPO of Snap, the parent company of the popular Snapchat app, Cramer reviewed his playbook for investors to make a move at the right time. ""I totally get where the bears are coming from, but I believe that, at least initially, the bulls are going to triumph here, and they could potentially keep winning for a whole lot longer than that,"" the "" he said. A typical daily average user of Snapchat visits the app more than 18 times a day for about 20 to 30 minutes of total activity. With the astounding 158 million people that use Snapchat, there are more than 2.5 billion snaps a day. According to Snapchat, the average user age ranges from 18 to 34 years old. While the online lending space has become a difficult place to be, SoFi is a privately held company that Cramer said is the one doing it right. SoFi started as an online lender that would refinance student loans taken out by graduates of elite universities, and has since expanded to personal loans, mortgage lending, asset management and life insurance. SoFi's business model is customized to offer customers career advice and even offers dating events to keep customers engaged. It has no fees, and its lending process has been simplified online. In just six short years it has funded $16 billion in loans, and just closed on a $500 million round in funding. Cramer spoke with SoFi's co-founder and CEO Mike Cagney, who explained what makes the company different. ""It's really the opportunity to reinvent how financial services work. It's the idea to bring speed, transparency and alignment into the equation. And that's what's missing today,"" Cagney said. Shares of Salesforce fell in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the company reported a robust quarter, but forward guidance was lighter than Wall Street expectations. Co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff explained the conservative guidance to Cramer, citing a shift in the foreign exchange atmosphere. In September, Benioff also pointed to foreign exchange headwinds for weaker forward guidance back in September, due to Brexit and said it resulted in a loss of $150 million in revenue. ""We just reported an unbelievable year. But our results can be tempered by the foreign exchange environments. So we are appropriately conservative when we give you those numbers,"" Benioff said. In the Lightning Round, Cramer gave his take on a few stocks from callers: Southwestern Energy Company: ""You are buying it betting that it's going to get real hot this summer because the fact is, it did not work this year because it was just too hot in the winter. And that's why that stock has gone down along with the whole group."" NetApp: ""It had a monster quarter and I think the stock can go higher. I really liked that quarter. Everything about it.""","[gave, forecast, far, worse, expected, These, perfect, metaphor, current, environment, market, thanks, Cramer, call, stay, home, economy, This, refers, thriving, Amazon, Netflix, Domino, allow, people, stay, home, save, Domino, delivers, pizza, accessed, device, order, home, Target, requires, people, leave, go, home, save, Domino, delivers, pizza, accessed, device, order, home, Target, requires, people, leave, go, store, Its, price, special, certainly, get, Amazon, delivers, right, customer, door, Amazon, Prime, member, We, question, entire, relevance, Target, particularly, price, go, percent, Three, plan, How, accessed, device, order, home, Target, requires, people, leave, go, store, Its, price, special, certainly, get, Amazon, delivers, right, customer, door, ...]",1.0

VIAB,Viacom Inc.,6:New Viacom CEO says Paramount turnaround will bolster earnings,"Thursday,  9 Feb 2017 |  7:39  AM ET"," Viacom's turnaround of Paramount and the film studio's relatively new television business will drive the company's earnings, new Viacom CEO Bob Bakish said Thursday. ""That business ... is on track to becoming a nice profit contributor to not only Paramount but, obviously, Viacom,"" Bakish said, speaking exclusively with CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" after Viacom reported its fiscal first quarter earnings. In a new strategy, Bakish said Viacom will strive to boost its cable franchise business with its announced turnaround of Paramount despite the increasing costs of investing in cable. ""There is no question Paramount had a rough couple of years,"" Bakish said, adding that the studio was ""an integral part of Viacom."" Despite Paramount's improved revenue, the studio reported a wider adjusted operating loss of $180 million for the quarter. ""At the same time, it's an iconic studio, over 100 years old,"" the CEO said. Viacom's new strategy for Paramount will raise awareness about its upcoming projects via the company's paid brands. Beyond that, Bakish noted Paramount's relatively recent addition of television production capabilities, which he said will stabilize the brand and create new opportunities going forward. ""A studio with only film production is actually a very volatile animal,"" he said. ""Under Amy Powell's leadership, we have built a very nice and rapidly growing TV production business with a broad range of clients"" including Viacom's ""flagship brand"" Nickelodeon, among other networks. Powell is president of Paramount's television and digital entertainment division. ""I'm confident that as we turn the page on this new strategy, we will restore Paramount to growth and profitability,"" Bakish said. ""A typical film studio should be in the 8 to 12 percent margin range. I believe we'll get there."" Viacom, owner of MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon, reported better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by growth in its domestic affiliate and theatrical revenues. Viacom's film business, which includes theater and licensing, saw revenue increase 24 percent to $758 million from a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue of $678.8 million, according to market research firm FactSet StreetAccount. Viacom's results come as Bakish is focused on turning around the business after years of falling domestic ad revenues and poor ratings as younger viewers increasingly watch content online, while Paramount has suffered from a lack of box-office hits. As part of the strategy, the company said Thursday it would focus its efforts on six ""flagship"" brands: Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., MTV, Comedy Central, BET and Paramount. Bakish, who was formerly head of Viacom's international business, became permanent CEO in December after controlling shareholders, the Redstone family, abandoned exploring a merger of Viacom and CBS. Sumner Redstone and his family own a controlling stake in Viacom and CBS through privately held movie theater company, National Amusements. Viacom's media networks business reported a slight 1 percent rise in revenue to $2.59 billion in the latest quarter. Analysts had expected revenue of $2.54 billion, according to FactSet StreetAccount. However, net income attributable to Viacom fell to $396 million, or $1 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $449 million, or $1.13 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned $1.04 per share, handily beating the analysts' estimate for 84 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 5.39 percent to $3.32 billion. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $3.18 billion.

LNG,"Cheniere Energy, Inc.",3:Cheniere Energy co-founder dishes out two ways the US has strong advantages in natural gas,"Wednesday, 22 Feb 2017 |  6:49  PM ET","After an unusually warm winter this year, some investors might think the natural gas in the U.S. could struggle. However, Tellurian co-founder and Chairman Charif Souki says the country is uniquely set up for two very strong advantages versus the rest of the globe. The first advantage is the more than 100 years' worth of reserves of natural gas that the U.S. has, thanks to production innovation. ""Three years ago, I thought they had finished improving, but no, they continue to lower the cost of production in the U.S. dramatically by a factor of 15, 20 percent every year,"" Souki told ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer on Wednesday. ﻿Watch the full segment here: Souki was the co-founder and CEO of Cheniere Energy, the nation's top exporter of liquefied natural gas. He was ousted from the role after a spat with activist investor Carl Icahn and the company's board of directors in December of 2015. Since that time, Souki founded a new company called Tellurian Investments, with the goal of finding new ways to profit on the cheap price of natural gas in the U.S. compared to the rest of the globe. In the beginning of February, Tellurian acquired Magellan Petroleum in a deal that took the company public. Tellurian is also working to build a new liquefied natural gas facility called Driftwood LNG, which is estimated to cost about $12 billion and will have the capacity to export approximately 26 million tons of LNG per year. ""The key thing is we are going to grow at our own pace. We are not going to worry about what everybody else is doing. And we have a formula that has worked in the past,"" Souki said. Souki outlined the approach for the company to first work with its suppliers as a part of the team, and then work with them to cut time and cost. The second element is to pay employees well based on performance, so they are inspired to produce results. And no, he isn't worried that the company won't be able to raise enough money needed to build its LNG facility. ""I've done it once when I had debt and I was in a hole, and this time I have a great advantage. I have no debt; I am starting with a fresh slate. And it's not that hard. Plus we have our experience behind us and our track record behind us,"" Souki said. Questions for Cramer? Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC Want to take a deep dive into Cramer's world? Hit him up!

MCD,McDonald's Corporation,9:Cramer: Moron sellers skewing the valuation of these stocks,"Thursday, 16 Feb 2017 |  6:12  PM ET","After watching the market on Thursday, it was blatantly obvious to Jim Cramer that information is simply not being valued accurately. ""When you see a stock that is down and then you read a headline that tells you why it is down, don't automatically presume that either the stock or the headline is right,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. Instead, go deeper, Cramer said. Read the reviews, find out what people are saying ahead of time, and listen to the company's conference call. That will automatically be far more homework than many other investors are doing. It could be the difference between starting a good investment instead of dumping one. PepsiCo reported a much better-than-expected quarter on Wednesday with strong growth, and then provided a forecast that mentioned obvious challenges of foreign exchange. In response, the stock fell on stories about how PepsiCo cut its forecast on the expectation of weaker sales. Cramer was screaming at his computer about how wrong the sellers were. ""Moron sellers had their minds made up that somehow this was a true guide down based on slowing sales,"" Cramer said. Sure enough, the stock reversed on Thursday when investors figured out that PepsiCo was merely adjusting its forecast because of the strong dollar, not because there was something wrong with sales. The same pattern played out with 3M, which was crushed because of what headline writers described as a weak consumer products division with an unexpected decline. But declines don't mean weakness to Cramer. Weakness insinuates a failure to have the right product and flagging sales. If investors had listened to the conference call they would have known that 3M's softness had to do with a particular retailer's troubles. CEO Inge Thulin has earned the benefit of the doubt from Cramer after making money for the company for years. It finally dawned on the market that investors were wrong when the stock reversed its downward trajectory on Thursday. Other examples of headline selling that Cramer cited were Cisco Systems, Chipotle, McDonald's and Micron. ""I wish the market weren't so darned stupid lately,"" Cramer said. Questions for Cramer?

Biogen — The drug maker earned an adjusted $5.04 per share for its latest quarter, beating estimates by 8 cents. However, revenue missed forecasts, and its 2017 revenue guidance also falls below Street forecasts. Analysts say Biogen is seeing relatively slow growth for its multiple sclerosis drugs.    Northrop Grumman — The defense contractor beat estimates by 17 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of $2.66 per share, with revenue also coming in above forecasts. Northrop saw better sales of in its aerospace systems business, which is involved in F-35 fighter jet production.    Stanley Black &amp; Decker — The tool maker earned $1.71 per share for its latest quarter, 3 cents above estimates, with revenue very slightly below forecasts. Its earnings were lower year over year, hurt by higher restructuring costs.    Whirlpool — The world's largest appliance maker missed estimates by 11 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of $4.33 per share, though revenue did slightly beat forecasts. Declining sales in the U.K. following the Brexit vote was among the factors hurting its results.    AT&amp;T — AT&amp;T matched estimates with adjusted quarterly profit of 66 cents per share, but missing on the top line as it continued to lose phone and video customers.    Johnson &amp; Johnson — J&amp;J struck a deal to buy European biotech company Actelion for $30 billion, after weeks of talks.    Qualcomm — Qualcomm earned $1.19 per share for its latest quarter, 1 cent above estimates, but the chipmaker's revenue fell below forecasts. Investors, however, remain concerned about lawsuits over its patent licensing practices and a recent South Korean government fine.    Las Vegas Sands — Las Vegas Sands missed estimates by 4 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of 62 cents per share, with the casino operator's revenue falling slightly short of forecasts as well. Results were impacted by results in Macau, which accounts for the majority of the company's business.    EBay — EBay posted quarterly results in line with forecasts at an adjusted 54 cents per share, while revenue was also in line with Street forecasts. The company did give a lighter than expected current quarter outlook, but made optimistic comments about its revamped platform.    Kraft Heinz — The food producer struck a joint venture deal with Oprah Winfrey to create a new line of food products.    Mattel — Mattel fell 19 cents shy of estimates with adjusted quarterly profit of 52 cents per share, while the toy maker's revenue missed as well.

Royal Bank of Scotland — The bank set aside nearly $4 billion for an expected settlement in the U.S. over the sale of mortgage-backed securities ahead of the 2008 financial crisis.    Diageo — Diageo posted better than expected quarterly sales, as the world's largest spirits maker saw improvements in its U.S. business.    Wal-Mart — The company escaped a possible $80 million fine when a judge refused to force the retailer to pay in a lawsuit involving California truck drivers. The jury had awarded the drivers more than $54 million in back pay, but the judge turned aside a motion for the extra penalty because he said the retailer had acted in good faith and believed it had been in compliance with California law.    Whole Foods Market — The grocery store operator is shutting down its three commercial kitchens, which manufacture ready-to-eat meals for stores. Whole Foods will outsource food preparation.    MoneyGram International — MoneyGram is near a deal to be bought by Alibaba unit Ant Financial Services, according to the Wall Street Journal. MoneyGram is a U.S. based money-transfer provider.

ETP,ENERGY TRANSFER PARTNERS,6:US judge rejects tribes' latest effort to stop Dakota Access pipeline progress,"Monday, 13 Feb 2017 |  4:26  PM ET","A U.S. District Court judge on Monday denied a request from Native Americans for a restraining order that would have temporarily halted work on the hotly contested Dakota Access Pipeline. The ruling allows Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners to continue drilling in order to complete the final stretch of the pipeline beneath the Missouri River in North Dakota as a legal challenge brought by Native American tribes plays out. It also raises concerns about potential clashes between authorities and protesters still camped out near the Dakota Access work site. The Army Corps of Engineers, which manages federal land in the area, plans to clear the camps next week. The Corps in December denied Energy Transfer Partners the easement it needed to complete the final stretch of the $3.8-billion project, but President Donald Trump ordered the Army secretary to move forward the process shortly after he took office. The Corps granted the easement last week and terminated plans to conduct an environmental review to identify alternative routes for the pipeline. Dakota Access pipeline route, source: Energy Transfer Partners  ""We're disappointed with today's ruling denying a temporary restraining order against the Dakota Access Pipeline, but we are not surprised. We know this fight is far from over,"" Chase Iron Eyes, lead counsel in the Dakotas for Lakota People's Law Project, said in a statement. ""The tribes will continue to pursue legal remedies through the courts, seek an injunction against the pipeline and push for the full Environmental Impact Statement to be completed,"" he said. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe filed a motion last week seeking the restraining order. The tribe, along with the Standing Rock Sioux, has opposed Energy Transfer Partners' plan to route the pipeline beneath Lake Oahe, a reservoir on the Missouri River that provides drinking water and is held sacred by the Sioux. Their protest has drawn thousands of people at times to camps on the Standing Rock Sioux reservation and near Cannon Ball, North Dakota. Protesters have clashed with local authorities and private security firms. In the motion, the tribe argued that the construction of a pipeline and flow of oil beneath Lake Oahe obstructs the free practice of the tribe's religion, Matt Vogel, a legislative associate for the Cheyenne River Sioux, told reporters on a conference call on Monday. Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court in Washington rejected the request at a hearing on Monday afternoon, Reuters reported. The ruling comes ahead of a Feb. 22 deadline, when the Army Corps of Engineers plans to remove structures set up by protesters near land it manages on a floodplain at the mouth of the Cannonball River. The Corps said forecasts for flooding in the coming weeks make it necessary to clear the area to prevent injury or death. Native Americans and their allies have established three new camps south of the Cannonball River in recent days, Iron Eyes told reporters during a conference call on Monday. But a number of campers are digging in north of the river, said Madonna Thunder Hawk, a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. These protesters aim to draw attention to a long-standing treaty dispute between the Sioux and the federal government. Just a few hundred protesters remain in the camp, but Trump's executive order has drawn some back to Standing Rock, including a network of veterans that is currently helping to clean up camps. Anthony Diggs, communications secretary for Veterans Stand, said the group will act within its capabilities to take nonviolent measures to protect protesters if tribe members ask them to do so. Iron Eyes said the veterans were there chiefly as observers, but raised concerns about clashes with authorities next week. ""There could be a forceable raid, so we need media and bodies to prevent anything bad from happening,"" he told CNBC.","[A, U, S, District, Court, Monday, denied, request, Native, Americans, restraining, order, temporarily, halted, work, hotly, contested, Dakota, Access, Pipeline, A, U, S, District, Court, Monday, denied, request, Native, Americans, restraining, order, temporarily, halted, work, hotly, contested, Dakota, Access, Pipeline, The, ruling, Oahe, obstructs, practice, tribe, religion, Matt, Vogel, legislative, associate, Cheyenne, River, Sioux, told, reporter, conference, Monday, Judge, James, Boasberg, U, S, District, Court, Washington, rejected, request, hearing, Monday, afternoon, Reuters, reported, The, ruling, come, ahead, Feb, deadline, Army, Corps, Engineers]",0.0

RMD,ResMed Inc.,1:Cramer Remix: The best way to play the oil patch,"Tuesday, 24 Jan 2017 |  7:25  PM ET","  President Trump attempted to fast track the Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines on Tuesday, proving to Jim Cramer that this will be the most pro-petroleum administration in American history.    However, that doesn't mean the price of oil is about to skyrocket.    ""While the oil producers will definitely benefit from deregulation and the approval of new pipelines, the actual outlook for the price of oil is more murky,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.    Ultimately, Cramer likes oil stocks in this environment, but warned that investors need to believe they can do well, even if crude stalls out. His top pick was Magellan Midstream Partners.    ""This is still one more reason why I think the pipelines are the best way to play the oil patch,"" Cramer said.    Cramer also found five themes that can continue to roar higher  and rebuke even the biggest doubters of the rally. They were housing, earnings, deregulation, higher oil, higher rates and the strength in materials stocks.     ""Aside from the deregulation component, most of this rally would have occurred regardless of Trump's initiatives, which means this move might be a lot more sustainable than the doubters would have you believe,"" he said.    D.R. Horton reported strong earnings on Tuesday and confirmed orders were up 15 percent. This matters because mortgage rates went up this quarter too. Typically when rates go up, housing gets hit. Instead, the largest homebuilder had a surprisingly strong level of confidence. Horton even said better employment will lead to better housing demand.  Shares of medical device maker ResMed soared more than 9 percent on Tuesday after reporting a strong quarter, with revenues up 16.7 percent year-over-year.     ResMed sells products to combat sleep apnea and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It makes continuous positive airway pressure machines — known as CPAP machines — that help people with sleep apnea not gasp for air when they sleep.    Cramer spoke with ResMed's CEO Mick Farrell, who said the company intends to use data from more than 1 billion nights of sleep for patients to create actionable information that patients can use to manage their own care, physicians can use to help patients and insurance companies and governments can use for population health management.    ""The opportunities are boundless in what we can do with this,"" Farrell said.    Deluxe Corp has also transitioned into an astounding rebound story. Somehow the century-old payment solutions business best known for printing checks has picked up 25 percent gain in 14 months.    The company's investments in brand awareness to let customers know that they are more than just a check company and were now a one-stop shop for the processes that many small businesses need, have paid off.    It was clear to Cramer that the execution of management was fabulous, too. With the stock at $73, Cramer thinks it is a steal.    ""I believe that small business will be the driver of growth going forward, not the big companies Trump has been meeting with, and Deluxe has solutions that they need in order to expand,"" Cramer said.     Cramer has been a skeptic of the value of unlimited trade for a very, very long time, but says he won't recommend Ford or General Motors if they close their foreign plants.    ""You can't have your protectionist cake and eat it, too. Meaning, when it comes to trade policy there is no scenario where everyone is a winner,"" Cramer said.    President Trump met with major automaker CEOs on Tuesday to urge them to build more plants domestically, saying these plants could ignite economically depressed towns and spur manufacturing in the U.S.    However, if the president only goes after domestic automakers then these companies will be at a disadvantage to the foreign competition who can build cars in places like Mexico. Cramer feared American auto companies could become losers.     In the Lightning Round, Cramer provided his take on a few stocks from callers:    Chesapeake Energy Corporation: ""I like that. They just paid off the preferred, they cleaned up the balance sheet. It's going to be the year of natural gas. I say buy, buy, buy. We were talking about buying that for my charitable trust. You've got a good one.""    Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc: ""I don't like the vaccine business, but more importantly I think that when you are in the crosshairs of the president on this drug issue it doesn't seem to end well.""

LMT,Lockheed Martin Corporation,20:Cramer Remix: Big news about an Apple supplier was obscured by the Trump inauguration,"Friday, 20 Jan 2017 |  7:19  PM ET","  Skyworks Solutions didn't just deliver a blowout quarter, it gave investors a road map to further blowouts, Jim Cramer said.    Apple supplier Skyworks was the market's biggest gainer on Friday, with shares skyrocketing 13 percent after reporting strong earnings and guidance.     ""There is now enough business involving mobile connectivity away from Apple and enough of a roadmap of the future toward 5G … that you can see why the stock soared,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.    It was music to analysts' ears when Skyworks management called the quarter ""growth and success outside our largest customer,"" and confirmed inventories are lean.    Cramer says America just swore in its first pure business president, Donald Trump—and it now marks a brave new world for investors.    While the possibility of a wave of post-inaugural selling of Trump-related stocks did cross Cramer's mind, he quickly realized that it likely won't happen. If Trump is true to his word, then investors could miss out on the potential gains.     Therefore, ringing the register here could be a mistake, he said.    ""You shouldn't take the President too literally when it comes to stock picking,"" Cramer said.    Cramer will also be using a new metric to evaluate companies. It all comes down to whether a stock is or isn't a Trump stock. Cramer expects Trump's agenda of deregulation, lower corporate taxes and repatriation of foreign assets to have a significant impact on the economy and stock market.   On the flipside, when Trump has a problem with a company, he's not afraid to Tweet what is on his mind—something that will put certain industries under fire.    ""You will feel a whole lot more comfortable owning the Trump stocks than the non-Trump variety,"" Cramer said.    However, political cross-currents could either mute or boost companies that report next week, Cramer said.    ""The...pro-business tripod are potent as we hit the heart of earnings season. But so are actual numbers. Be ready for real opportunities next week,"" Cramer said, referring to President Trump's platform of deregulation, repatriation of money overseas and lower corporate taxes. Cramer believes those elements will be good for the stock market in the long-run.    With this in mind, he outlined the stocks on his radar next week.    Tuesday: 3M, Lockheed Martin3M: Voted by Cramer as one of the stocks that could help the Dow reach 20,000, he recommended buying shares both before and after it reports.    Lockheed Martin: Cramer is interested in seeing if Lockheed will trim its forecast because of the price cut to the joint strike fighter, which was done to concede with Trump's wishes. If it doesn't guide down, Cramer said the stock could fly high.    In the Lightning Round, Cramer provided his take on a few stocks from callers:    Activision Blizzard: ""My favorite has always been Take-Two. I've been with Take-Two the whole way. It's got more mojo than Activision Blizzard, but I like Activision Blizzard.""    Array Biopharma: ""That is a speculative stock. You have got a chance right now to play with the house's money.

DE,Deere & Company,6:Cramer’s game plan: Spotting the perfect combination for a positive tape next week,"Friday, 10 Feb 2017 |  6:26  PM ET"," Jim Cramer thinks the averages could continue to roar higher next week, but recommended keeping one eye on tweets from President Donald Trump, and the other on earnings. ""Remember, if rates are up and oil is up, then the tone of the tape will be positive,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. That should free up investors to trade some of the names on Cramer's radar next week. He outlined the stocks he will be watching:  Monday: Teva Pharmaceuticals, Noble Energy Teva: This stock is right up there with Valeant on Cramer's list, and he is worried about the company's balance sheet after it doubled down and paid $40 billion for Allergan's generic business at peak. Noble: This company could tip investors off on how oil stocks are really doing now that OPEC appears to be pretty serious about supply cuts. Tuesday: T-Mobile, Diamondback Energy T-Mobile: Cramer is willing to bet that CEO John Legere will deliver a strong quarter. He thinks the company can keep its momentum going without having to merge with another company. ""Be aware that there have been occasions where T-Mobile has reported a blowout quarter and the stock has sold off,"" Cramer said. Diamondback: With the fastest growth of any of the Texas oil plays, Cramer said this stock will work as a trade. Wednesday: PepsiCo, Applied Materials, CBS PepsiCo: Unlike Coca-Cola, which reported a quarter that wasn't very exciting, Cramer expects PepsiCo to shine because of its snack business. With PepsiCo playing the stay-at-home thesis that is sweeping the country, Cramer expects good things. Applied Materials: Cramer thinks it will deliver better-than-expected results, given how well the chip business is doing and how well Lam Research has done. CBS: This stock is always a crowd pleaser. Cramer expects CEO Les Moonves to have positive things to say about ratings, programs and distribution. Sometimes the stock responds negatively to positive news, but then turns right back up. Cramer anticipates it won't be different. Thursday: MGM Resorts, Zoetis MGM Resorts: With good news coming out of China on gambling and a surge in new casino gambling in Vegas, MGM could report great numbers that could send the stock above the $28 to $30 range finally. Zoetis: The humanization of pets theme has also driven stocks like Idexx Laboratories higher. Thus, this animal and livestock drug company could post better than expected numbers. Friday: Campbell Soup, Deere, VF Corp Campbell: This stock is a real conundrum for Cramer. Its last quarter was disappointing, but the stock has been climbing since, as if someone has taken a large position in the stock in order to influence management. ""The Dorrance family owns a big chunk of it, but the stock just acts too well for me to believe it's being propelled by itself,"" Cramer said. Deere: It might not even matter what Deere says on Friday. The industrial agriculture cohort continues to trade up, and Cramer says Deere could paint a better worldwide picture for investors. VF Corp: This stock has been absolutely horrendous, but it seems like it is trying to bottom.

SKT,"Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc.",2:Cramer Remix: The stock that lives and dies with the border tax,"Friday, 24 Feb 2017 |  7:16  PM ET","Warren Buffett taught Jim Cramer, and many other investors, that the stock market is made up of stocks and not completely tied to politics or the averages. That's why when the market pulled back from its remarkable run on Friday, Cramer wasn't calling for a top. Instead, he will be watching the moves that individual companies make next week. ""If individual companies report good numbers, they can buck the top calling trend provided the economy remains as strong as we have seen since the year began,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. With this in mind, he outlined the stocks and events he will be watching next week. One stock on his radar recently is Constellation Brands, which has been impacted by the possibility of President Trump's proposed border tax. However, Cramer clarified that it has a unique edge because the Mexican beers it imports, like Corona and Modelo, can't be made in the U.S. A Mexican beer made in Flint, Michigan isn't a Mexican beer.  While the retail cohort has been struggling recently, Jim Cramer slammed the vitamin retailers as being worse off than the rest of the group. Two of the largest publicly-traded players in the space are GNC Holdings and Vitamin Shoppe, which both initially roared higher after coming public, but have fallen dramatically in the past two years. ""We've got two very ugly train wrecks here,"" Cramer said. Initially, these two stocks were loved, as more people became obsessed with losing weight, doing cleanses and taking supplements. Vitamin Shoppe went public in 2009 and GNC in 2011 and for the first few years the stocks were solid growth stories. But by the time 2015 came along, the companies started to struggle as nothing they did seemed to work and business slowed. Shares of live entertainment company Live Nation fell 3 percent on Friday, but Cramer thinks this was merely because the stock has run up so much and investors were profit-taking after the gains. Live Nation owns 167 venues in seven countries, along with four of the five largest music festivals in North America. It also has an artist management business and owns Ticketmaster. After the company delivered a small top and bottom line beat with solid guidance, Cramer spoke with CEO Michael Rapino so said he is very proud of the results. ""We had a spectacular record year, and the best news is it looks sitting here in February like we are on to 2017 on another continual strong year,"" Rapino said. Back in December, Cramer introduced investors to CBRE Group as a way to play real estate without actually owning a real estate investment trust. REITs tend to become less attractive when the Fed raises interest rates because their high yield suddenly becomes competition to higher yielding bonds. CBRE is the world's leading purveyor of commercial real estate services. Not only does it own property, but it also helps real estate investors by providing outsourced leasing, sales, appraisal, development and property management services. Since Cramer's recommendation, CBRE has rallied more than 20 percent. The company has also made three acquisitions. Cramer spoke with CBRE's CEO Bob Sulentic, who said he expects President Trump's agenda to be healthy for the economy moving forward. ""The talk about tax rates getting better is helpful, the talk about infrastructure spending is helpful, lower regulation could be really good for a lot of our clients particularly financial institutions so we're hopeful that good things will happen,"" Sulentic said. Cramer envies the rich hedge fund managers that have the audacity to call a top in the market. They never need to be right because the worst case scenario is that they are early. ""Top calling, like loving, means never having to say you're sorry,"" he said. Somehow the top-caller's position or performance never are discussed when they are calling a top. After all, that would be rude for Cramer to say: ""I see this is your fifth top call during a period when the Dow Jones Average has gone from 18,000 to 20,000 … and I have read your investment letters for years and you have repeatedly said the market is dangerous and you were underexposed to the market each time, so are you still underexposed, or short?"" But that is exactly what Cramer thinks is the right thing to do. In the Lightning Round, Cramer gave his take on a few stocks from callers: Palo Alto Networks: ""After speaking with Chuck Robbins last week from Cisco, I started to get a little bit more nervous about Palo Alto Networks and the aggressive way that Chuck is coming on in cybersecurity. So let's just say, not as strong as I felt one time ago before I spoke with Chuck."" Tanger Factory Outlet: ""Almost 4 percent yield and I think that is still an experiential opportunity when you go to those. By the way, in good times and in bad times, bingo.""","[worst, scenario, Top, calling, like, say, sorry, said, Somehow, top, caller, position, performance, discussed, calling, top, After, rude, Cramer, say, I, top, period, Dow, Jones, Average, gone, I, investment, letter, year, repeatedly, said, market, dangerous, underexposed, market, time, underexposed, But, said, Somehow, top, caller, position, performance, discussed, calling, top, After, rude, Cramer, say, I, top, period, Dow, Jones, Average, gone, I, investment, letter, year, repeatedly, said, market, dangerous, underexposed, market, time, underexposed, But, exactly, Cramer, think, right, In, Lightning, Round, Jones, Average, gone, I, investment, letter, year, repeatedly, said, market, dangerous, underexposed, market, time, underexposed, But, exactly, Cramer, think, right, ...]",1.0

X,United States Steel Corporation,1:Stock that’s more than quadrupled is still attracting the bulls,"Wednesday,  1 Mar 2017 |  8:00  AM ET","Call it the stock of steel: With two months down in 2017, U.S. Steel is on track to follow an astonishing year with a phenomenal one. After finishing 2015 under $8, more than 80 percent below its September 2014 high, the stock has made a startling recovery, more than quadrupling in value in 2016. And it kicked off 2017 with a rally of nearly 20 percent, which took the stock to nearly $39 on Tuesday. Even after such a move, there's still time for investors to buy in 
, according to a research report this week from Cowen metals and mining analyst Novid Rassouli. The increasing use of steel in U.S. oil production, in addition to internal corporate restructuring, led the analyst to do a rather extreme about-face on the stock, raising his rating from market perform to outperform and taking his price target on the stock from $36 to $60. Recently, U.S. Steel has seen a major boon thanks to optimism about President Donald Trump's anticipated economic policies. While many companies would fear a potential trade war, increased tariffs would be great news for domestic steel producers like U.S. Steel, which have recently had trouble competing with producers in China and elsewhere. In late January, Trump insisted that certain oil pipelines be crafted from American steel. The company has also been a beneficiary of increasing economic optimism. Steel demand is highly levered to the overall corporate outlook, which helps explain why U.S. Steel shares tend to rise and fall alongside the market as a whole, but much more dramatically. Over the past three years, the stock has enjoyed a beta of 3.7, meaning that if the S&amp;P rises 10 percent in a given period, U.S. Steel could be expected to rise 37 percent. This is the highest beta of any company of its size or larger within the broad S&amp;P 1500 index, according to data from FactSet. At this point, ""the stock could be a little overbought,"" said Boris Schlossberg of BK Asset Management, pointing to a surge of optimism in the analyst community, as well as a potential slowdown in auto sales. From a chart-centricperspective, Ari Wald of Oppenheimer said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" that the stock ""is getting back to some pretty formidable resistance in the low- to mid-$40s, which marked the stock's peak back in $40."" While acknowledging that its ""trend is still very positive,"" Wald concluded that ""we see more attractive opportunities elsewhere right now."" Still, for those bullish on overall stocks and on the oil sector, U.S. Steel could prove an appealing, if highly volatile, pick.","[Call, With, month, U, S, Steel, track, follow, astonishing, phenomenal, After, finishing, percent, September, made, startling, recovery, quadrupling, value, And, kicked, rally, nearly, Call, With, month, U, S, Steel, track, follow, astonishing, phenomenal, After, finishing, percent, September, made, startling, recovery, quadrupling, value, And, kicked, rally, nearly, percent, Call, With, month, U, S, Steel, track, follow, astonishing, phenomenal, After, finishing, percent, September, made, startling, recovery, quadrupling, value, And, kicked, rally, nearly, percent, took, took, nearly, Tuesday, Even, move, time, investor, buy, according, research, report, Cowen, metal, mining, analyst, Novid, Rassouli, The, increasing, use, U, S, oil, production, addition, internal, corporate, restructuring, ...]",1.0

Adami said Nordstrom's name in the news will help the stock have a nice rally.

He said sentiment around the sector is low and he would wait until the summer to get into the area.

DAL,"Delta Air Lines, Inc.",9:Trump promises a major tax announcement in a few weeks,"Thursday,  9 Feb 2017 |  2:19  PM ET","President Donald Trump, facing doubts about the speed of his promised tax reform, said Thursday he will announce a plan in a few weeks. In a meeting with U.S. airline executives, Trump spoke again on removing regulations for American businesses.  ""Lowering the overall tax burden on American business is big league ... that's coming along very well. We're way ahead of schedule, I believe. And we're going to announce something I would say over the next two or three weeks that will be phenomenal in terms of tax,"" Trump said. In a press briefing on Thursday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters that Trump realizes middle-class Americans need tax relief and that the U.S. needs ""fundamental comprehensive tax reform."" The president also wants to create a tax plan that keeps jobs here, and incentivize companies to grow and come here, Spicer said. Stocks and Treasury yields had jumped in the wake of Trump's Nov. 8 victory, amid the prospects for looser regulations in certain sectors, lower tax rates and fiscal stimulus. However, investors appeared to be worried about delays after complications surrounding Republican attempts to repeal and replace Obamacare. In a Fox News interview that aired Sunday night, Trump said a replacement for Obamacare might not be ready until next year. ""You have to remember Obamacare doesn't work, so we are putting in a wonderful plan,"" Trump told Fox News' Bill O'Reilly. After Trump's comments on Thursday, the 10-year Treasury yield moved up slightly. The dollar also jumped on Trump's announcement. The S&amp;P moved about 4 points. ""That added to the bearish price action that was already in place. It was more contributing to the negative tone that was in place. His comments were worth about two basis points,"" said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO. ""People were talking about it,"" he said, but added that it provided no detail and therefore not much clarity for the markets. Trump met on Thursday with U.S. aviation executives to discuss the industry's aging airports and air traffic control reform. Trump said the current government contract for a new air traffic control system is not good and is ""obsolete."" Trump said the head of the Federal Aviation Administration should be a pilot. The White House meeting came at a time of heightened tension within the industry after U.S. carriers raised concerns about ongoing trade agreements with foreign carriers. Trump has vowed to renegotiate or scrap trade deals he sees as unfair between the United States and other countries. The Trump administration had not yet addressed the U.S. carriers' competition concerns. Following the meeting,  Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said the company plans to hire 25,000 people over the next five years with the support of ""a level playing field globally."" ""We had a positive discussion about many of the major issues facing U.S. travelers, airline employees and the aviation industry, which is a vital economic engine for America. I look forward to working with President Trump, Secretary Chao, Secretary Tillerson and other members of the administration on issues important to Delta, our employees and our customers,""  Bastian said in a statement. United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz said the company was committed to protecting and creating American jobs. ""We look forward to working together with the president on the many initiatives and issues that will make America better and the U.S. aviation industry the best in the world. This includes modernizing our aviation infrastructure and cutting the red tape that gets in the way of our industry's ability to deliver the best experience for our employees and customers,"" he said. Jetblue and Alaska Airlines also released statements, saying they had positive meetings with the president. —CNBC's Patti Domm and Reuters contributed to this report.","[President, Donald, Trump, facing, doubt, promised, tax, reform, said, Thursday, announce, plan, In, meeting, U, S, airline, executive, Trump, spoke, removing, regulation, American, business, Lowering, overall, tax, American, business, big, league, coming, S, airline, executive, Trump, spoke, removing, regulation, American, business, Lowering, overall, tax, American, business, big, league, coming, We, ahead, schedule, I, believe, And, going, announce, I, say, phenomenal, term, tax, Trump, said, In, press, briefing, Thursday, White, House, spokesman, Sean, removing, regulation, American, business, Lowering, overall, tax, American, business, big, league, coming, We, ahead, schedule, I, believe, And, going, announce, I, say, phenomenal, term, tax, Trump, said, In, ...]",1.0

BABA,Alibaba Group Holding Limited,7:Alibaba ventures Down Under to help local businesses go global,"Sunday,  5 Feb 2017 |  8:04  PM ET","Alibaba Group opened the doors to its latest overseas headquarters in Melbourne on Saturday, marking another chapter in the e-commerce giant's worldwide expansion. The new office is aimed at supporting the 1,300 Australian and 400 New Zealand businesses selling on Tmall and Tmall Global, Alibaba's online retail platforms, as well as attracting new merchants, according to the company's statement. But delivering e-commerce services isn't Alibaba's sole mandate Down Under. It also intends on building the entire operating infrastructure for regional businesses to expand globally, which includes cloud computing, online payments and logistics, said Maggie Zhou, managing director of the new Melbourne office. Indeed, Alibaba has been increasingly focusing on the cloud. Last month, the Chinese behemoth signed a 12-year partnership with the International Olympic Committee to provide both cloud and e-commerce services. Alibaba already boasts a strong presence in Australia and New Zealand. Alibaba Cloud opened a data center in Sydney last year and further expansion in sectors such as travel and digital entertainment are in the pipeline, Zhou said. Alibaba's international business-to-business website has been operating in Australia since 1999 and more than 1,000 bricks-and-mortar stores across the two countries accept Alipay, the e-wallet app owned by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial. Before attending the headquarter's opening ceremony on Saturday, founder and exective chairman Jack Ma met with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in Sydney to discuss Ma's e-World Trade Platform project, a blueprint for small and medium enterprises to gain exposure to the global economy. As part of his visit, Ma also donated $20 million to the University of Newcastle for a new scholarship program and signed a memorandum of understanding with Australia Post to bring the state-run logistics firm to Southeast Asia's e-commerce market via Alibaba-owned Lazada Group. Australia Post will also work with Alibaba's logistics arm, Cainiao Network, to improve data integration and develop a cross-border delivery service for Australian outbound parcels to China, Saturday's statement said. —Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.","[Alibaba, Group, opened, door, latest, overseas, headquarters, Melbourne, Saturday, marking, chapter, e, commerce, giant, worldwide, expansion, The, office, aimed, supporting, Alibaba, Group, opened, door, latest, overseas, headquarters, Melbourne, Saturday, marking, chapter, e, commerce, giant, worldwide, expansion, The, office, aimed, supporting, Australian, Alibaba, Group, opened, door, latest, overseas, headquarters, Melbourne, Saturday, marking, chapter, e, commerce, giant, worldwide, expansion, The, office, aimed, supporting, Australian, New, Zealand, business, selling, Tmall, Tmall, Global, Alibaba, online, retail, Saturday, marking, chapter, e, commerce, giant, worldwide, expansion, The, office, aimed, supporting, Australian, New, Zealand, business, selling, Tmall, Tmall, Global, Alibaba, online, retail, platform, attracting, merchant, according, company, ...]",1.0

UNH,UnitedHealth Group Incorporated,7:Cramer uses Warren Buffett’s investing method to spot 5 long-term Dow winners,"Thursday, 26 Jan 2017 |  6:14  PM ET","Warren Buffett always talks about investing in America for the long-term, and owning the best of the best stocks to generate more wealth.    Jim Cramer used the notion of long-term investing to take a look at the stocks that rallied the most, from the time when the Dow Jones industrial Average was at 10,000, to its latest level at 20,000.   He boiled it down to five winners that were totally achievable, and in some cases downright obvious.    ""They are here because management has been terrific, innovation extraordinary and their attention to customer's superb. Those are difficult traits to erase even if [President] Donald Trump fails to get much done,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.   The biggest winner since the Dow was at 10,000 was UnitedHealth, which has more than quadrupled in the last decade. There wasn't much competition, and UnitedHealth pulled out of the Obamacare  when it realized it wasn't making money.    That move made it the only healthcare company worth owning right now, Cramer said, because it's not stuck in Obamacare if it goes away.     ""It is the only healthcare Trump stock I know. I think it can go much higher,"" Cramer said.    Next was Home Depot, which has tripled in the last 10 years. It was able to pull off such strong numbers during the worst housing recession in history, which was nothing short of amazing to Cramer. It used the downturn to solidify its position in the market.    No. 3 was Apple, which has also more than tripled in the same period. This is what happens when a company has the best and most sought after product. When the stock was at $93, naysayers were convinced Apple's best days were behind it.  CEO Tim Cook came on ""Mad Money"" and told Cramer he disagreed and laid out a multi-year strategy. The stock is now at $121.    Visa was next on the list as the paper-to-plastic play in the payment space. While Cramer thinks there are years of growth ahead for the company, he is worried that its CEO Charlie Scharf just retired, making him less certain about Visa's future.    The last player was Disney, which aside from Apple is the most obvious stocks in the world to buy for Cramer. From its movies and theme parks, it has cornered the kid market. The stock has been down lately on worries about ESPN subscriptions.    ""CEO Bob Iger has multiple levers, including selling ESPN if he has to — although I think that would be a big mistake — in order to keep generating the 266 percent return that Disney gave you from Dow 10,000 to 20,000,"" Cramer said.    All five of these stocks were integral to the Trump rally. Additionally, most will benefit from lower corporate taxes and repatriation of foreign assets, making them prime picks for Cramer as the market powers higher.    Questions for Cramer?

In a study released Thursday, the investment firm analyzed the market's performance going back to 1948 versus measures of inflation and found an inverse correlation between the two variables. ""As inflation ticks higher, small, mid, and large [cap companies] tend to weaken and vice versa. Inflation heading higher means that interest rates should also rise, and thus valuations for equities falls,"" McCarthy wrote.

BABA,Alibaba Group Holding Limited,"16:Before Trump gets his inauguration, China's president swipes some of the spotlight","Friday, 13 Jan 2017 | 10:59  AM ET","Chinese President Xi Jinping is about to take center stage at the ultimate gathering of globalists from the world over, and he hopes to make his country the middle of global attention while he's at it. Xi will speak before elite business and political leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos next Tuesday, just days before populist President-elect Donald Trump is sworn into office in the United States. Beijing will use the appearance in Switzerland to favorably contrast Xi and China with Trump and the United States. Already before taking office, Trump has leaned hard on American companies to keep operations in the U.S., and he has chosen vocal China critics for top positions on trade and defense. In contrast, Xi is expected in his opening plenary speech to play up China as a proponent of globalization. ""I think China's trying to send a signal that it's the world's most responsible stakeholder. The U.S. by contrast is a greater source of anxiety, tensions and volatility,"" said Scott Kennedy, deputy director, Freeman Chair in China Studies, at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.    ""The growing tensions between the U.S. and China gives this a bigger, larger significance than it otherwise would have,"" he said.    Xi will be the first Chinese president to attend the World Economic Forum's Davos gathering and comes as part of a state visit to Switzerland, just ahead of the Lunar New Year. Xi is a well-traveled Chinese leader who is also expected to consolidate his own power within China at a Communist Party congress this fall.     As the leader of the world's second-largest economy, Xi will embrace the opportunity at Davos to show that the international community needs to pay attention to China's interests.    ""More than ever, China has to raise a voice, when we know President-elect Trump is challenging, criticizing China,"" said Richard Attias, who produced the World Economic Forum in Davos for 15 years and now heads consulting firm Richard Attias &amp; Associates. ""When you are challenged you need to react and I think what President Xi is doing is right.""    At Davos, the Chinese ""will talk to the businesses coming to explain to them, despite all the promises of President-elect Trump, [that] China will still be an interesting place to invest and include in your strategies,"" Attias said.    Beijing has taken several recent steps to position more at the center of global trade and finance. Last January, China launched the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to serve as a financing alternative to the U.S.-led World Bank. More recently, China is stepping in replace the United States as the central player in Pacific trade, following the U.S. Congress' failure to ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement that was negotiated by the Obama administration.   China's investments include projects in Africa, Latin America and the European Union, and Beijing's ""One Belt, One Road"" program seeks to build infrastructure that links the country to surrounding underdeveloped regions.     China's heavily state-influenced companies have been on a buying spree, snapping up businesses, property and technology from Europe, Japan, Australia and the United States. Last year, China's global outbound foreign direct investment jumped by a whopping 40 percent to an estimated nearly $200 billion, according to a report released this month by Rhodium Group and the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin.     Supported by a growing awareness that China uses protectionism and state supports to give its companies unfair advantages against the rest of the world, the Trump administration wants to reset the relationship between the two countries.     ""I sense a lot of anxiety here in part because they're not really sure what the ask is from the incoming administration,"" Kennedy said, speaking from Beijing. ""They are not ... sure what they are going to do and whether [when] they achieve those things they can achieve equilibrium.""     Trump has picked ""Death by China"" author Peter Navarro to head a newly formed National Trade Council, and tapped for the U.S. Trade Representative post Robert Lighthizer, a lawyer who's fought against China dumping steel into the U.S. market.     Trump's ""selection of the key economic advisors in the new administration, suggests there's likely to be increased tensions in coming years,"" said Yukon Huang, a senior fellow in the Carnegie Asia Program and formerly the World Bank's country director for China.     That means in his Davos speech, Xi ""also has to indicate intentions in the future to continue liberalizing … objectives which the U.S. leaders and European leaders would want to support,"" Huang said.     Xi has been criticized outside of China for slowing or reversing some of the country's progress toward greater openness and economic liberalization.

GE,General Electric Company,22:Cramer's game plan: All eyes on the cheapest stock of the Dow,"Friday, 13 Jan 2017 |  6:16  PM ET","With earnings season kicking off next week, Jim Cramer has his head in the game, but warns not to buy any stocks that have moved up too much.    However, he will have his eyes on American Express, which he calls the cheapest stock in the Dow Jones industrial average.    ""The playoffs are here and there is money to be made in the financials and the industrials and the oils,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.    With this in mind, he outlined the stocks and events he will be watching next week:         Tuesday: Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth, CSXMorgan Stanley: Cramer expects the company to report a strong quarter, although he is unclear if the market will react as positively as the other banks. He said to use any potential weakness to do some buying.    UnitedHealth: Declared as the biggest winner among the HMOs if Obamacare is repealed, Cramer said to get in on it if the stock comes in after it reports.    CSX: As a major railroad company, Cramer is most interested to hear what the company predicts for the future of coal under a President Donald Trump administration.    ""Trump promised beleaguered coal mining states they would have relief from his White House. I think that is a big reason why CSX's stock has been so hot,"" Cramer said.    Wednesday: Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, NetflixBoth Goldman and Citi are the most prone to going down after they report, Cramer said, because they tend to come in after reporting a good quarter.  When the trading window opens for Goldman soon after it reports, Cramer expects there will be a large number of insider sales. That is the time to buy it.    Netflix: Now that analysts have beaten this stock down so much ahead of the quarter, Netflix is now in a position where it must blow away expectations—or the stock will get slammed.    ""I love the company, I love the stock, but at this point I think you have to say you missed it, simply because so many analysts have already pushed Netflix up. No, I don't think Apple will buy them,"" Cramer said.    Thursday: Union Pacific, American Express, IBMUnion Pacific: If CSX goes up, so will Union Pacific, Cramer said. However, the company has a large Mexican business, so the stock could be impacted by Trump. Cramer said to take a pass on this stock because of political concerns.    American Express: The stock clearly lags the group, so Cramer is expecting an out-sized performance.    IBM: While the stock is also cheap and has faster growing businesses than before, Cramer doesn't think the numbers will be a real barn burner.     Friday: Schlumberger, General Electric, Inauguration daySchlumberger: Cramer thinks management will be cautious about 2017, per the usual, but will talk about the need for bigger projects to maintain production growth. He thinks Wall Street will like what it has to say.    General Electric: The industrial giant needs to iron out the details of its merger with Baker Hughes. It needs to pay out more and buy back more stock if it wants to trade higher.

Wendy's announced a new $150 million stock buyback, as well, and raised its quarterly dividend to 7 cents per share from 6.5 cents. Time Inc. — The magazine publisher fell 3 cents a share short of estimates, with quarterly profit of 75 cents per share. Revenue missed expectations, as well. The company was hurt by a decline in ad sales, although digital ad revenue did increase substantially. Alexion Pharmaceuticals — The drugmaker earned an adjusted $1.26 per share for its latest quarter, a penny a share above estimates. Revenue fell short of Street forecasts, however, and the company gave a lower-than-expected 2017 earnings outlook as sales of its flagship blood disorder drug Soliris fall. Avon Products — The cosmetics maker fell 8 cents a share short of estimates, with adjusted quarterly profit of 1 cent per share. Revenue also missed estimates, as sales were lower in most of its global markets. GNC Holdings — The nutritional supplements retailer earned an adjusted 7 cents per share for its latest quarter, well short of the 36 cent a share consensus estimate. Revenue also missed, and GNC announced it was suspending its quarterly dividend. The company noted, however, that its results do not yet reflect the recent overhaul of its business model. Tempur Sealy — The mattress retailer came in 5 cents a share above estimates, with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.18 per share. Revenue also topped Street forecasts. The company said worldwide demand for its products is ""solid."" Cisco Systems — The networking equipment maker reported adjusted quarterly profit of 57 cents per share, 1 cent a share above estimates. Revenue was essentially in line with forecasts. Cisco's results got a boost from strong sales of its security-related offerings. CBS — CBS came in a penny a share above estimates, with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.11 per share. Ad revenue dropped nearly 3 percent as the network broadcast fewer NFL games, though the number was aided by political spending. TripAdvisor — TripAdvisor fell 15 cents a share shy of estimates, with adjusted quarterly profit of 16 cents per share. The travel review website operator also saw revenue fall short of Street forecasts. TripAdvisor reported a drop in both subscription revenue and in display ad spending. Applied Materials — Applied Materials posted adjusted quarterly profit of 67 cents per share, 1 cent a share above estimates. The maker of semiconductor manufacturing equipment's revenue was in line with forecasts. The company also made upbeat comments about the year ahead. Kraft Heinz — Kraft Heinz beat analyst estimates by 3 cents a share, with adjusted quarterly profit of 91 cents per share. The food maker's revenue beat forecasts, as well. The producer of Heinz Ketchup and Oscar Mayer meats saw its bottom line benefit by lower input costs, among other factors. Marriott — Marriott reported adjusted quarterly profit of 85 cents per share, 1 cent a share above estimates. The hotel operator's revenue also came in above forecasts. Revenue per available room was in line with estimates, as is Marriott's current-quarter guidance.

Molina Healthcare — Molina lost $1.54 per share for its latest quarter, compared to consensus estimates of a 75 cents per share of profit. The health insurer also saw revenue miss forecasts, as did its full-year 2017 outlook. Molina, which focuses on the Medicaid market, blamed challenges stemming from the Affordable Care Act. McDonald's — The restaurant chain is the target of a complaint by a Chinese consultancy, which says the company's sale of its China-based business may hurt workers and consumers. The complaint comes from Hejun Vanguard Group, which was instrumental in winning antitrust disputes with both Coca-Cola and Apple.

AET,Aetna Inc.,11:Health insurer Aetna's quarterly profit beats,"Tuesday, 31 Jan 2017 | 12:33  PM ET","Aetna, whose $34 billion deal for Humana was blocked last week, reported quarterly profit ahead of estimates on Tuesday, helped by higher premiums for its insurance plans and lower-than-expected medical costs. Aetna's results come nearly two weeks after Republican President Donald Trump signed his first executive order, directing the federal government to scale back regulations, taxes and penalties under the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. Insurers, including UnitedHealth and Aetna, largely pulled out of these plans for 2017, saying they were losing too much money.  Aetna's net profit fell to $139 million, or 39 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $321 million, or 91 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, Aetna earned $1.63 per share, handily beating analysts' average estimate of $1.44 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Aetna said its total health care medical benefit ratio — the percent of premiums spent on claims — rose to 82.1 percent from 81.9 percent, a year earlier, mainly due to higher medical costs in its individual commercial products. The No. 3 U.S. health insurer's total revenue rose about 5 percent to $15.73 billion but was below analysts' average estimate of $15.86 billion. Total medical membership came in at 23.1 million at the end of December, lower than 23.49 million, a year earlier. The company said it expects 2017 operating earnings of at least $8.55 per share. Analysts' on average estimated earnings of $8.79 per share. The decrease in quarterly net income was primarily due to an increase in restructuring costs, which included a $215 million expense recorded during the quarter related to a voluntary early retirement program. Restructuring costs and exchange medical loss ratio pressured the quarter but was offset by performance in the government and group insurance businesses, Piper Jaffray analyst Sarah James said. Aetna and Humana have said they will consider all available options for their proposed merger after a court ruled against the deal, saying it would lower competition. ""We believe this combination will provide a better product for seniors, a better product for the Medicaid population [that is] more affordable and simpler,"" Aetna chairman and CEO Mark Bertolini told CNBC's ""Squawk Alley"" on Tuesday. ""We're disappointed where we are now, but until Feb. 15 we really don't need to make a call and we're doing all of the homework necessary now to understand what our next steps could be,"" he said, referring to the merger agreement's extended deadline. The court ruling also casts doubt on Anthem's proposed $54 billion deal to buy fellow health insurer Cigna. The Justice Department filed a lawsuit last July to block the two deals, arguing they would lead to higher prices. A court ruling on the Anthem-Cigna deal is pending.","[Aetna, Humana, blocked, reported, profit, ahead, estimate, Tuesday, helped, higher, premium, insurance, plan, expected, medical, cost, Aetna, result, come, nearly, Aetna, Humana, blocked, reported, profit, ahead, estimate, Tuesday, helped, higher, premium, insurance, plan, expected, medical, cost, Aetna, result, come, nearly, Republican, President, Donald, Trump, signed, executive, order, directing, federal, government, scale, regulation, tax, penalty, Affordable, Care, Trump, signed, executive, order, directing, federal, government, scale, regulation, tax, penalty, Affordable, Care, Act, popularly, known, Obamacare, Insurers, including, UnitedHealth, Aetna, largely, pulled, plan, saying, losing, Aetna, net, profit, cent, share, ended, Dec, cent, share, earlier, Excluding, item, Aetna, earned, government, scale, regulation, tax, ...]",1.0

PZZA,"Papa John's International, Inc.",1:Cramer Remix: This side of Wall Street thinks Trump is dangerous,"Monday,  6 Mar 2017 |  7:06  PM ET","Jim Cramer knows that stocks have had a big run, and some of them could fall. But when he spent the weekend looking over the charts, he found 10 groups flying high that indicated that the market could have more room to run. ""I believe these big money managers are cynical haters, not skeptical tire kickers. They aren't wary buyers. They are unwary sellers. They despise the setup and find themselves wanting to sell everything at a moment's notice,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. In fact, Cramer likes how disappointed so many money managers are. He believes that many hedge fund managers are traditional Republicans by nature and can't figure out President Trump, and therefore think he is dangerous. But Cramer doesn't view the stock market through the lens of the White House. The global economy has gotten better, and that is what matters to him. Almost every market he follows is up, and none of these countries have Trump at the helm. They simply have better business conditions. With low interest rates, it was bound to happen. Cramer reminded investors that when they see a stock with an absurdly high yield, they need to stay the heck away from it. ""I don't care how tempting the dividend looks or how cheap the stock seems. A super-high yield that is totally out of whack with its peers is almost always a sign that something is very, very wrong and you need to run, not walk away as fast as you can,"" he said. Cramer also hears questions about how much investors should pay for stocks. It has become a serious dilemma, and the banks are in the center of it all. It was just a year ago that Wall Street valued bank stocks from their book value, especially ones impacted the most by regulation. Book value refers to what a stock would be worth if the company liquidated the business tomorrow. A good example of this was Bank of America's valuation. Last year at this time, the stock traded between $13 and $14 a share, and management argued that it deserved to be valued by its book value of around $15. Before the election, with Hillary Clinton in the lead, Bank of America flirted with a new $16 book value. But then the surprise election results changed everything, and the stock flew to $20. The stock closed at $25 on Monday, and Cramer said to let the position ride. ""Until everyone understands the new normal where, after a decade, we can at last value Bank of American on its earnings, then I think this one's got more room to run,"" Cramer said. Sometimes a company has several different businesses under one roof, creating a situation where the sum of the parts is actually worth more than the whole. When that happens, spinning off one of the divisions as an independent company can make a killing for shareholders. Manitowoc Foodservice, maker of kitchen equipment for the restaurant industry, rebranded itself as Welbilt, officially trading under the symbol WBT on Monday. Cramer spoke with Welbilt's CEO Hubertus Muehlhaeuser, who explained the reason for the name change. ""I think it was a 'Back to the Future' strategy. We wanted to cut off the last tie to the Manitowoc company, and Welbilt was actually the leader in our industry in the last century … It resembles what we are. We are in the heart of the kitchen, and Welbilt is in the heart of the kitchen, so it was natural,"" Muehlhaeuser said. Cramer was very worried about the pizza space going into Domino's Pizza's earnings last week, as weakness from Yum Brands' Pizza Hut and Papa John's indicated that there was a price war heating up. That was all proved wrong when Domino's earnings knocked it out of the park, including a 12 percent increase in domestic same-store sales. On Monday, he spoke with Domino's CEO Patrick Doyle who said the investments that the company has made in its stores, food and technology during the past few years are now paying off both internationally and domestically. ""We view ourselves as a work-in-progress brand,"" Doyle said. ""We continue to find places that we can improve the experience for the customer and as long as we are making investments that do that, that can permanently improve the experience for our customers and we think we are going to continue to grow."" In the Lightning Round, Cramer gave his opinion on a few caller stocks: AT&amp;T: ""I would be a buyer, 4.67 percent yield with a good business strategy. I think it makes sense to be a buyer of AT&amp;T."" Cabela's: ""I thought they were going to go the way of being taken over. I don't want anything in retail. Literally, nothing.

JNJ,Johnson & Johnson,"4:Johnson & Johnson lifts lid on drug pricing data, shows 3.5% net hike in 2016","Monday, 27 Feb 2017 | 11:00  AM ET","Johnson &amp; Johnson, the world's largest health-care company, issued a new report Monday detailing data on its medicines' price increases. The message: We've been responsible, but the public hasn't been able to tell because of lack of transparency. The report, which J&amp;J says it plans to issue annually, comes as the pharmaceutical industry has once again become a national target for its pricing practices. And the message, that there's more to pricing than meets the eye, has been the industry's primary response — a response most visibly employed by Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch amid controversy over pricing of the EpiPen. ""We understand the concerns of patients, families and other stakeholders who are worried about health care costs, including the costs of prescription medicines,"" wrote Jennifer Taubert, J&amp;J's company group chairman for pharmaceuticals in the Americas, and Anastasia Daifotis, chief scientific officer for J&amp;J's Janssen North America pharmaceuticals unit, in the report. ""They are calling on us to provide greater transparency about how we operate — including disclosing more information on our pricing and marketing practices, our patient access programs and our clinical trials."" The report focuses specifically on the U.S., where the 2016 presidential election included drug pricing as a key issue. President Donald Trump has continued his focus on drug prices since, saying the industry is ""getting away with murder"" for its pricing practices and vowing to bring pricing down. The industry has argued it's being unfairly maligned in the pricing debate, that there's more to the price of medicines than the list prices that are made public. And in response to pressure, many are providing more data on the discounts and rebates they pay into the health-care system, to government insurers and middlemen including pharmacy benefits managers. J&amp;J's report does just that, explaining the difference between list and net prices and the complicated path of drug payments through the reimbursement system. And it says over the last five years, its list prices have increased, on average, less than 10 percent, while its net prices, after discounts and rebates, have generally increased less than 5 percent. In 2016, J&amp;J says discounts and rebates on its medicines amounted to about $11 billion in the U.S., or a discount rate of 35 percent off the list price. And it says the net increase in the cost of its medicines, of 3.5 percent across its portfolio, is lower than the 4.1 percent rate of medical inflation in the U.S. last year. Other drug companies have made pledges to limit list price increases. Allergan CEO Brent Saunders pledged, in what he called the company's social contract, to limit increases to less than 10 percent once a year. Novo Nordisk and AbbVie made similar commitments. J&amp;J's data show it's generally already been doing that. But Americans feel drug prices are a problem. Seventy-seven percent said prescription drug costs were unreasonable in a Kaiser Health poll in September 2016, at the height of the backlash over the price of the EpiPen, which rose fourfold in a decade. And many Americans support actions to keep costs down, the poll found, including allowing the federal government to negotiate with drug companies to lower prices for Medicare. J&amp;J focuses on that issue specifically in its report, arguing that the private insurers and PBMs that collectively administer Medicare Part D benefits already are ""powerful negotiators with leverage to secure large discounts and rebates on behalf of Part D plans."" But Trump has supported Medicare negotiation as well. And with each one-off drug pricing scandal — from Martin Shkreli to the EpiPen to, most recently, a drug for kids with Duchenne muscular dystrophy — the scrutiny on the whole industry's pricing practices is reignited.","[Johnson, amp, Johnson, world, largest, health, care, company, issued, report, Monday, detailing, data, medicine, increase, The, message, We, responsible, public, Johnson, amp, Johnson, world, largest, health, care, company, issued, report, Monday, detailing, data, medicine, increase, The, message, We, responsible, public, able, tell, care, company, issued, report, Monday, detailing, data, medicine, increase, The, message, We, responsible, public, able, tell, lack, transparency, The, report, J, amp, J, say, plan, issue, come, pharmaceutical, industry, national, target, pricing, practice, And, message, pricing, meet, eye, industry, primary, issued, report, Monday, detailing, data, medicine, increase, The, message, We, responsible, public, able, tell, lack, transparency, The, report, ...]",1.0

BlackRock confirmed the news early Wednesday. Shares of JPMorgan rose 1 percent as the broader market rallied and the Dow Jones industrial average topped the 20,000 milestone for the first time.     A State Street spokeswoman told CNBC that the firm will still retain custody over some of BlackRock's assets.     ""We remain a significant service provider for BlackRock, and the transition will not be fully completed until 2018,"" she said.

DAL,"Delta Air Lines, Inc.",19:Cramer Remix: Why 4 downgrades can't hold back this energy stock,"Thursday, 12 Jan 2017 |  6:58  PM ET","  Cramer's interest is always piqued when a stock gets hit with a series of downgrades and then refuses to go lower.     The price of oil dropped sharply in early November, and analysts became worried about the oil patch, especially the drillers. That is how oil and gas drilling contractor Helmerich &amp; Payne was downgraded four times in one month.    The problem is that by the time the stock was downgraded in the first half of December, oil had already rebounded and the demand for drilling was clearly picking up.    ""They failed to adjust to the new reality, which is why this stock barely seemed to notice [its] downgrades,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.   That's also why Cramer considers this stock worth owning at current levels, especially with the 4 percent yield that pays investors to wait for the rebound in drilling.    Like it or not, President-elect Donald Trump is succeeding in his mission to protect and create American jobs.    ""What matters is when it comes to strong-arming executives into keeping jobs in this country, Trump's got the supermarket going for him,"" Cramer said.    This term refers to a lesson Cramer learned from the ""Mad Money"" wall of shame. When Cramer speaks with executives who have been on the wall of shame for destroying value at companies, he often hears within the plea from the executive that they want to be taken down because they don't want their spouse stared at in the supermarket.    Granted, Cramer's bully pulpit is a fraction of the size of Trump's methods in tweets and press conferences. But if CEOs get uncomfortable about being on the ""Mad Money"" wall of shame, imagine the embarrassment factor when the President of the United States singles them out on Twitter.    Amazon's announcement to create 100,000 jobs in the U.S. by 2018 on Thursday also marked a shift in the business paradigm for Cramer. The significance of this is that Amazon chose to take a path that didn't exist just a few months ago. Many other stocks have taken the same action since the election after being bogged down by gridlock in Washington that stifled growth.    Industrials have rallied on the belief that demand will grow with a government in Washington that is no longer in the way and with the notion that Donald Trump will work with businesses that create jobs in the U.S. Delta also confirmed its business grew in December, echoing the sentiment of United Airlines. Homebuilder KB Home also said things have gotten better since the election.    The market will now be drawn to these kinds of stocks, Cramer said, not just the companies that were oldies-but-goodies because of their consistent slow growth and decent dividend.    ""It is a seismic shift in stock picking, and Amazon is the most extreme example,"" Cramer said.    Advance Auto Parts' stock has picked up a juicy gain since activist hedge fund Starboard Value took a stake in the company and Cramer is wondering about its exit strategy already.    ""It's no sin; even the best have to ring the register sometime. Specifically, I think Advance Auto Parts could be an ideal takeover candidate,"" he said.    More importantly, Cramer is convinced that this could be a motivated seller situation as Starboard's position in AAP is likely only to be up slightly. Given that the position represents 11.5 percent of the fund's portfolio, he thinks Starboard would agree to arrange a sale and pick up a gain.    While AutoZone and O'Reilly seem like natural acquirers, Cramer thinks O'Reilly is the more likely option because it is larger and has a cleaner balance sheet.    ""This could be one of the most straightforward takeover stories out there,"" Cramer said.    In the Lightning Round, Cramer gave his take on a few caller stocks:    Visteon: ""I know Visteon has run a lot. The problem is that there has been upgrade, upgrade, upgrade, upgrade. You've got to let it come down a little and then you can pull the trigger. Not yet.""    American Tower: ""It has fallen out of favor because there is a lot of talk that there is going to be mergers in the business. I would say that American Tower is the best of the business. James Taiclet [CEO] is worth owning. I think the stock if you get it under $100 is terrific. I know the chart looks very bad.""","[gridlock, Washington, stifled, growth, Industrials, rallied, belief, demand, government, Washington, longer, notion, Donald, Trump, work, business, create, job, U, S, Delta, confirmed, business, grew, December, echoing, sentiment, United, Airlines, Homebuilder, KB, Home, said, thing, gotten, better, election, The, market, drawn, Advance, Auto, Parts, picked, juicy, gain, activist, fund, Starboard, Value, took, stake, company, Cramer, wondering, exit, strategy, It, sin, Specifically, I, think, Advance, Auto, Parts, ideal, takeover, candidate, said, More, importantly, Cramer, convinced, motivated, seller, situation, Starboard, position, AAP, likely, Reilly, like, natural, acquirer, Cramer, think, O, Reilly, likely, option, larger, cleaner, balance, sheet, This, straightforward, takeover, story, Cramer, said, ...]",1.0

""This action reminds me of the old days when we had companies that had so much business and so much room for expansion that all you wanted was for them to keep investing in order to grow,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.   In response, the market rewarded Amazon's stock by blowing through the $800 mark.    The significance of this to Cramer is that Amazon chose to take a path that didn't exist just a few months ago. Many other stocks have taken the same action since the election after being bogged down by gridlock in Washington that stifled growth.

Trump has targeted some sectors, with pharma being the latest, but to Cramer, Trump is much more pro-business than President Barack Obama.    ""Say what you want about Trump's style or grace, if you think having business people surround the president will help us produce more jobs, as I do, than we are going to see a lot more growth,"" Cramer said.    That means more stories like Amazon will bubble up, and fewer tales about companies firing employees to make the numbers.    This marks a new paradigm. Investors are now buying companies where demand has picked up and not those using artificial ways to boost their stock price.    Those are the stocks Cramer says to buy right now.

XIV,VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short Term ETN,1:The hottest Trump trade of them all just set a new record,"Thursday, 16 Feb 2017 | 12:39  PM ET","In Washington, volatility is running at highs not seen in years. On Wall Street, volatility is running at lows not seen — ever. The stock market is on a 48-day run of not having moving up or down more than 1 percent in any single session, something that rarely happens and is all the more remarkable considering the political commotion since President Donald Trump took office nearly four weeks ago. The level of realized volatility is the lowest in records going back to 1962. In terms of intraday price movements, the S&amp;P 500 has never started a year with a tighter range than it has seen since 2017 began, according to analysts at Sandler O'Neill. Stocks have been on a gradual but steady move higher, with the index gaining just shy of 10 percent since the controversial Republican took over. Such market complacency normally would be a matter of concern. A market that shows little or no reaction to outside noise gets increasingly susceptible to a downturn should something meaningfully jolting come along. But in this case, the mellow mood on Wall Street appears to be a reflection that the market and the economy have hit a sweet spot that has divorced itself from the political chaos, and the lack of volatility is justified. Rather than serve as a contrarian signal that a reckoning is on the horizon, the low volatility readings are ""a false warning,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. ""The market seems to want to focus on what could be the positives,"" he said. ""If we get a pro-growth agenda and move forward, the market is (focusing on) that a whole lot more than the market's worried about a constitutional crisis in the Mike Flynn fiasco."" Flynn was Trump's national security advisor who resigned Monday following disclosures that he had conferred with Russian operatives, despite denying that he did so. While a blow like that to the new president might have knocked the market for a loop, the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 1.4 percent this week. Investors don't anticipate much trouble ahead, either. The CBOE Volatility Index, a gauge of options traders' expectation for the S&amp;P's fluctuations over the next 30 days, is well below its historical average. Indeed, betting against volatility has been the best Trump trade of them all. The VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term exchange-traded note bets against the index over one- and two-month periods. The wager has delivered a 78.6 percent gain over the past three months and is up more than 318 percent during the past 12 months. The VIX has tumbled 12 percent in 2017, close to a record, and is down nearly 50 percent over the past 12 months, according to Sandler O'Neill. The firm's measure of actual volatility against the VIX's measure of implied volatility is at a record low as well. The VIX's long-term average is just under 20, but it has averaged around 15.6 for the past five years and just above 12 since Trump won the presidency in November, according to Convergex data. Traditionally, the index rises when the market falls. However, that's not always the case. Wednesday's gain saw a massive VIX spike even as the market staked out yet another new high. Nick Colas, chief market strategist at brokerage Convergex, believes a ""volatility reset"" may be the case in the days ahead as relatively constant numbers tied to economic growth begin moving in surprising ways. ""Since both equity and fixed income markets are now discounting faster economic and corporate earnings growth, the predictability of the last five years should give way to more uncertainty about those key drivers of stock prices,"" Colas said in his morning note Thursday. ""And with that, the VIX should rise from its current torpor."" Rising corporate earnings following a profits recession and expectations for higher interest rates will be two key drivers in market volatility, even if they're not rally-killers.  ""The upshot of all this is simple: the VIX can (and should) rise in the current macro environment, even if equities continue to rise,"" Colas said. ""Earnings will become less predictable, albeit in a 'good way' because we will be unsure if they can grow at 8 percent or 12 percent. Or maybe 15 percent ... And interest rates should similarly pull away from their historical roots."" So while the market may keep drifting up, expecting the same level of market complacency could be a mistake. ""On one hand, you've got to respect the momentum in the market,"" said Todd Salamone, senior vice president at Schaeffer's Investment Research. ""There's something that lurks that makes me think that this could be something contrarian. If all of a sudden the VIX pops ... I cannot say I'd be overly surprised.""","[In, Washington, volatility, running, high, seen, year, On, Wall, Street, volatility, running, low, seen, The, market, run, moving, percent, single, rarely, happens, remarkable, considering, political, commotion, President, Donald, Trump, took, office, nearly, ago, The, level, realized, volatility, lowest, record, going, In, term, intraday, movement, S, amp, P, started, tighter, seen, began, according, analyst, Sandler, O, Neill, Stocks, gradual, steady, move, political, commotion, President, Donald, Trump, took, office, nearly, ago, The, level, realized, volatility, lowest, record, going, In, term, intraday, movement, S, amp, P, started, tighter, seen, began, according, analyst, Sandler, O, Neill, Stocks, gradual, steady, move, higher, index, gaining, shy, ...]",1.0

JPM,JPM,39:Cramer warns bank stocks need to be valued entirely different now,"Friday, 13 Jan 2017 |  6:31  PM ET","  The stock market finally turned a new leaf on Friday, and Jim Cramer says bank stocks can now be valued based on earnings.    That might seem obvious to some, but it has been a long time since actual earnings were taken into account for bank stocks.    ""Bank stocks can now be valued not on net interest margins, or book values, or loan losses and Justice Department fines, but earnings … they are the cheapest stocks in the market,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.    Investors remembered that banking is actually a good business on Friday, when they rewarded those shares with big gains after reporting, even after many of the gains were repealed by an oil-related pullback.    JPMorgan reported an 11 percent deposit growth and 14 percent core loan growth, yet the stock sells at just 12 times earnings.    Bank of America has also had strong loan and deposit growth, along with the lowest percentage of loan losses in the bank's history.    Even after scandal, Wells Fargo still had 6 percent deposit growth.  Under President-elect Donald Trump ""...I think there will be a recognition that the banks have too much capital and they need to be allowed to dividend more of it to their shareholders or make more home loans,"" Cramer said.    Cramer also expects compliance expenses to peak, and automation to replace expensive people who examine the paperwork.    Ultimately, with banks now valued on earnings, the ""cheapest stocks in the market"" could have a big run ahead of them.    Questions for Cramer?

BWLD,"Buffalo Wild Wings, Inc.","1:Buffalo Wild Wings execs have 'not put their money where their mouth is,' activist says ","Wednesday,  8 Mar 2017 |  2:54  PM ET","Activist hedge fund manager Mick McGuire is lobbying for changes at popular wing restaurant Buffalo Wild Wings. McGuire, who runs Marcato Capital Management, has been pushing for the company to franchise more of its restaurants since July and even nominated four directors to the company's board in February.  On Wednesday, McGuire once again took aim at Buffalo Wild Wings, publishing a presentation for investors that argued the executives' interests were not closely aligned with the wing chain's shareholders. ""Since its IPO in 2003, Buffalo Wild Wings' Board and Management team have sold the vast majority of all stock ever owned,"" McGuire said in a statement. ""In our view, this lack of long-term ownership has contributed to failures of governance and oversight, poor capital allocation discipline and the severe lack of urgency in navigating the difficult operating environment. Shareholders deserve a Board and management team that is willing to commit its own capital alongside them."" McGuire noted that none of the Buffalo Wild Wings executives currently owns shares in the company and only one director has ever executed an open-market purchase of the stock.  He also argued that B-Dubs management team has been using equity incentive plans to purchase shares at a lower price and then sell them on the market to make cash. ""Buffalo Wild Wings leadership has not put their money where their mouth is,"" McGuire said. Buffalo Wild Wings responded by saying that its directors' interests are ""closely aligned"" with those of its shareholders, noting that its team owns ""significant equity interests"" in the company.  ""Virtually all trading of the company's common stock owned by management — who receive approximately half of their compensation in performance-based stock awards — is executed under preexisting plans that are commonly adopted for personal financial planning purposes,"" the company said in a statement.  Marcato owns 5.6 percent of the company and is hoping to get McGuire and three other nominated directors onto the board.

PEP,"Pepsico, Inc.",16:Cramer argues why AAP is ready to catch a juicy takeover bid,"Thursday, 12 Jan 2017 |  6:40  PM ET","  Advance Auto Parts' stock has picked up a juicy gain since activist hedge fund Starboard Value took a stake in the company and Jim Cramer is wondering about its exit strategy already.    ""It's no sin; even the best have to ring the register sometime. Specifically, I think Advance Auto Parts could be an ideal takeover candidate,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.    For years, auto parts retailer stocks drove higher thanks to an anemic economy that required Americans to go for longer periods of time without buying a new car. As the average age of a vehicle on the road increased, so did the amount of maintenance.    That meant stocks like Advance Auto Parts, AutoZone and O'Reilly Automotive moved higher. Then suddenly a few years ago the group decoupled, and while AutoZone and O'Reilly continued to move, Advance Auto Parts seemed to plateau.   The underperformance caught the attention of Jeff Smith of activist hedge fund Starboard Value. Starboard took a 3.7 percent stake in Advance Auto Parts and planned to unlock value. Fifteen months later, Cramer saw signs of progress, with AAP as the best performer of the group.    One of Cramer's rules is that he never recommends a stock on a takeover basis unless he likes the fundamentals. In its open letter to the company's management, Starboard pointed out that AAP's operating margins were 800 to 900 basis points behind AutoZone and O'Reilly, and they wanted management to close the gap with a series of operational improvements.    At the time, the stock was at $170 and Starboard argued that AAP could travel to $350 or even $400 if it could boost margins and improve execution. The company replaced one-third of its board of directors and added an extra seat for Smith.    Unfortunately, these announcements hit at the same time the company reported a subpar quarter with weak guidance, and that weakness overshadowed the changes.    All through last year, Starboard worked with AAP to institute a better leadership team, and hired 30-year PepsiCo veteran Thomas Greco as the new CEO and appointing Smith as chairman of the board. This gave Starboard more influence over the business.    ""It has worked so well that I think all sorts of acquirers could be salivating over this company at these levels,"" Cramer said.    Given that there are just three major auto parts retailers out there, AAP is a natural target, Cramer said. Whoever acquired them would instantly become the largest player in the space.    AAP's fundamentals seem to have changed, too. If it can continue to put up better numbers than Cramer is confident it will become a growth property again. It also has a clean balance sheet with just $1.05 billion in debt.    More importantly, Cramer is convinced that this could be a motivated seller situation as Starboard's position in AAP is likely only to be up slightly. Given that the position represents 11.5 percent of the fund's portfolio, he thinks Starboard would agree to arrange a sale and pick up a gain.    While AutoZone and O'Reilly seem like natural acquirers, Cramer thinks O'Reilly is the more likely option because it is larger and has a cleaner balance sheet.    ""This could be one of the most straightforward takeover stories out there,"" Cramer said.    Questions for Cramer?  Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC    Want to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?

KSS,Kohl's Corporation,4:Beaten-down department store stocks could be ready to rally,"Monday, 13 Feb 2017 | 11:15  AM ET","Department store stocks have tumbled 13 percent since the chains started reporting holiday sales results last month. But the struggling retail segment may soon be poised for a rally.  Despite long-term threats from declining store traffic, a shift in consumer spending toward the web and off-price stores, and weak sales trends, Morgan Stanley analyst Kimberly Greenberger said these chains could experience a rally after they report fourth-quarter results next week. That's because investors' views on the group are so pessimistic, and it will be facing its easiest first-quarter comparisons since the recession in 2008 and 2009. In particular, Greenberger upgraded J.C. Penney shares from underweight to equal weight, citing less risk given their double-digit decline this year. Still, the analyst cautioned that any bounce in the space would likely be short-lived. ""We've seen the 'easy compare' script before,"" Greenberger said, referring to the third and fourth quarters of 2016. ""[We] would use any strength into first quarter earnings per share prints in May to trim positions."" Macy's kicks off department store earnings reports on Feb. 21. Expectations for the sector are already dim, as Macy's, Kohl's and Penney's previously reported lower comparable store sales for November and December. Instead, analysts will be watching the companies' fiscal 2017 guidance. Investors will also be eyeing Macy's for updates regarding a potential sale. Barron's said the chain's shares could rise 50 percent if it were to be acquired. This assessment followed reports that the retailer is exploring a sale. Yet even with a spike in share prices following those reports, Macy's stock is down nearly 9 percent this year. Cowen &amp; Co. analyst Oliver Chen told investors that even if a deal were to come through (Saks' parent Hudson's Bay was rumored as a potential buyer), Macy's fundamental challenges would not disappear. ""A buyer would likely need to be excited or prepared to execute better than current management with respect to a turnaround,"" Chen said.","[said, chain, experience, rally, report, result, That, investor, view, group, pessimistic, facing, easiest, comparison, recession, In, particular, Greenberger, upgraded, J, C, Penney, share, underweight, equal, weight, citing, risk, given, double, digit, decline, Still, analyst, cautioned, bounce, space, likely, lived, We, We, use, strength, earnings, share, print, May, trim, position, Macy, kick, department, store, earnings, report, Feb, Expectations, sector, dim, Macy, Kohl, Penney, previously, reported, comparable, store, November, December, Instead, analyst, watching, company, fiscal, guidance, Investors, eyeing, Macy, update, regarding, potential, rise, percent, acquired, This, assessment, followed, report, retailer, exploring, Yet, spike, share, price, following, report, Macy, nearly, percent, Cowen, amp, ...]",1.0

ETP,ENERGY TRANSFER PARTNERS,2:Trump's new pipelines are going to get a 'dog fight' in some parts of the United States,"Wednesday,  1 Mar 2017 | 10:44  AM ET","Pipeline companies can look forward to four years under a president who trumpets fossil fuels and wants billions spent on infrastructure projects. But even with Donald Trump in office, those hopeful companies will find themselves in a ""dog fight"" in some areas, experts say. Firms looking to lay pipe in the South and Great Plains will face few hurdles, but efforts to transport natural gas to the Northeast will have to clear a higher bar. Meanwhile, opposition to pipelines is percolating among environmentalists and regular citizens intent on keeping them out of their neighborhoods. That movement drew vitality from a months-long campaign by Native Americans to block Energy Transfer Partners from completing its Dakota Access pipeline in North Dakota. Thousands joined the Standing Rock Sioux at camps to oppose the project, and others took action through regional protests and divestment campaigns. That fight had roots in a more than century-old treaty dispute, making it something of an outlier, but the movement it sparked should not be ignored, said Jay Hatfield, a portfolio manager for InfraCap's AMZA exchange-traded fund, which tracks pipeline companies. ""It would be remiss to not recognize that there's an increasingly radical element of the environmental movement that believes that the ideal solution to the global problem is civic unrest,"" he said. Before the Dakota Access standoff, Transcanada's Keystone XL pipeline became a symbol of President Barack Obama's environmental stance. His administration blocked the project, arguing that transporting heavy Canadian crude into the United States undercut American leadership on tackling climate change. To be sure, the energy industry laid a tremendous amount of pipe during the Obama years. In the first six years he was in office U.S. oil pipeline mileage expanded by 26 percent. Still, Obama's actions on the two projects came amid a raft of new rules on oil, gas and coal production, feeding the perception of an anti-fossil fuel president. Following Trump's approval of both projects, pipeline companies are more optimistic but still concerned after coming out of a ""really tough regulatory period"" for the energy industry, said Libby Toudouze, portfolio manager at Cushing Asset Management. ""It's going to slowly, I think, continue to get better. It was a hurdle and now it's a speed bump,"" she said. The portfolio managers expect the Obama-era pipeline boom to continue in western Texas and basins in central and southern Oklahoma. Drillers will need more capacity there as activity in the low-cast basins ramps up amid a sustained but tepid recovery in oil prices. Pipelines in that part of the country also tend to run through less densely populated areas, meaning they encounter less resistance from landowners and others. There is also plentiful infrastructure already in place, so new projects tend to be relatively small connections to existing pipelines. ""If you want to find an easier place to build a pipeline in the world, it would be hard to find one better than Texas,"" Hatfield said. Oklahoma is second on the list, he added. Pipeline builders won't get such a warm reception in another part of the country: the Northeast. New England, and Boston in particular, are vulnerable to winter price shocks because they remain under-served by natural gas pipelines. Located near the natural gas-rich Marcellus shale in Pennsylvania, these densely populated areas have long been hotbeds of opposition to pipelines. ""It's going to be a dogfight in the Northeast, for sure,"" Hatfield said. Pennsylvanians opposed to Williams Companies' Atlantic Sunrise natural gas pipeline have taken a page from Standing Rock activists, erecting structures in the project's path and threatening civil disobedience. Last year, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation blocked another Williams project, the $875 million Constitution pipeline. Trump's election could affect such disputes. Three of the five seats on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission are currently vacant, giving him an opportunity to stack it with Republicans who represent the energy industry. The independent agency can override state decisions on interstate pipelines in some cases — though FERC has historically avoided partisan fights. Trump has created uncertainty for the industry by saying he will require pipeline makers to use only U.S. steel and American-made pipes in their projects — most recently in a high-profile address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night. But it's not clear that the U.S. steel industry can supply that much raw material, at least not anytime soon.","[undercut, American, leadership, tackling, climate, change, To, sure, energy, industry, laid, tremendous, amount, pipe, Obama, year, In, year, office, U, S, oil, pipeline, mileage, expanded, percent, Still, Obama, action, project, came, amid, raft, rule, oil, gas, coal, production, feeding, perception, state, decision, interstate, pipeline, case, FERC, historically, avoided, partisan, fight, Trump, created, uncertainty, industry, saying, require, pipeline, maker, use, U, S, American, made, pipe, project, recently, profile, address, joint, session, Congress, Tuesday, night, But, clear, U, S, industry, supply, raw, pipeline, maker, use, U, S, American, made, pipe, project, recently, profile, address, joint, session, Congress, Tuesday, night, But, clear, U, ...]",0.0

Bill Gates does the dishes every evening. Warren Buffett starts his mornings with a meal from McDonald's. Indra Nooyi, the CEO of PepsiCo, writes more than 400 letters each year to the parents of her senior executives. The letters are a unique display of gratitude, Nooyi explains on ""The David Rubenstein Show."" And they have had quantifiable results. When Nooyi first became CEO of the now $150 billion company back in 2006, she visited India, where she had grown up, to see her mother. ""When I got home and I sat in the living room, a stream of visitors and random people started to show up,"" Nooyi tells Rubenstein. ""They'd go to my mom and say, 'You did such a good job with your daughter. Compliments to you. She's CEO.' But not a word to me."" Besides a short greeting, the visitors didn't speak to Nooyi at all.  Nooyi realized that it was her mother and her late father who were responsible for much of her success. They deserved to reap the praise.   And yet, Nooyi says, the parents of great leaders and employees rarely get recognition for their work.    ""It occurred to me that I had never thanked the parents of my executives for the gift of their child to PepsiCo,"" she says.        After the trip, Nooyi wrote to the executives that report to her, sharing the story of her upbringing and what happened on her visit. Then she wrote a letter to the parents of those employees, expressing her gratitude.    ""I wrote a paragraph about what their child was doing at PepsiCo,"" she says.  ""I said, 'Thank you for the gift of your child to our company.'"" Nooyi says the letters opened a ""floodgate of emotions.""  Parents wrote back to her to say they were honored, Nooyi recalls, and shared the letter with friends and family.   Some of the executives told her, ""'My God, this is the best thing that's happened to my parents. And it's the best thing that's happened to me.'""    The letters make her employees feel appreciated and their families feel proud. This likely translates to higher workplace satisfaction, as feeling appreciated is one of the most significant factors contributing to an employee's view of their company.    It also likely contributes to Nooyi's strong in-house approval rating of 75 percent, according to about 1,800 anonymous employee reviews.

TWTR,"Twitter, Inc.",2:Trump is making it harder for Republicans in Congress to accomplish what they want,"Monday,  6 Mar 2017 |  1:48  PM ET","The challenge facing congressional Republicans in delivering on their ambitious health-care, budget and tax ideas keeps getting steeper. To meet their goals — putting in place a replacement for Obamacare by Easter, then a new budget and then sweeping tax reform by August — Republicans need a strong partner in President Donald Trump to push past political obstacles. But Trump's wild weekend wiretapping accusations against his predecessor weakened him. At the most rudimentary level, Trump's evidence-free Twitter tirade immediately dominated the attention of the political world. They threw fellow Republicans on the defensive in responding to allegations from Trump that both FBI director James Comey and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper immediately moved to discredit. Republican lawmakers were tepid at best in standing up for the president. More significantly, the credibility of an American president is an indivisible asset. Trump began his presidency laboring under widespread skepticism about his truthfulness; an NBC News/Wall Street Journal Poll last week showed only 34 percent of Americans rate him highly for honesty. Anything that further erodes faith in his honesty makes it more difficult for him to persuasively advocate for Republican priorities — including on health care and tax reform. Between intraparty disagreement and blowback from Democrats and independents, Republicans were already struggling to deliver on their ambitious legislative agenda. They have yet to act on their commitment to repeal and replace Obamacare, though they have signaled they will release separate bills to reduce Medicaid funding and roll back Obamacare tax provisions this week. Among their core health-care problems: Republican governors and congressional moderates want to prevent millions of Americans from losing health insurance they got under Obamacare, but GOP conservatives oppose measures that would help do so, on the grounds they would establishment a new entitlement that amounts to ""Obamacare-lite."" Even Trump himself has said he would not support reductions in insurance coverage. Republican senators have made clear they oppose major elements of the House approach on both health care and tax reform. But they have not advanced plans of their own. For now, House Speaker Paul Ryan aims to kick-start momentum by beginning the legislative process on health care, whatever the ultimate destination. As one Ryan friend told me, the speaker's principal motivation at this stage is holding his Republican caucus together while political storms swirl around him. That's what Ryan's predecessor John Boehner tried to do before conservative dissidents forced him out.","[partner, President, Donald, Trump, push, past, political, obstacle, But, Trump, weekend, wiretapping, accusation, predecessor, weakened, At, rudimentary, level, Trump, evidence, Twitter, tirade, immediately, dominated, attention, political, world, They, threw, fellow, Republicans, defensive, responding, allegation, Trump, FBI, director, James, Comey, Director]",0.0

M,Macy's Inc,6:Macy's earnings beat expectations but revenue falls short,"Tuesday, 21 Feb 2017 | 12:44  PM ET","Macy's earnings topped analysts' expectations Tuesday, but its top line fell short as it struggled to get consumers into its stores over the holiday period. The retailer sees tough times persisting during the fiscal year that just began, as shoppers continue to spend more of their money online. Shares of the chain were roughly flat in afternoon trading, having given up their earlier gains. Here's how the company did in the fourth quarter: ""While 2016 was not the year we expected, we made significant progress on key initiatives that are starting to bear fruit,"" CEO Terry Lundgren said in a statement. ""These include continued improvement in our digital platforms, the rollout of our new approach to fine jewelry and women's shoes, an increase in exclusive merchandise and the refinement of our clearance and off-price strategy."" Like its department store peers, Macy's has been struggling to attract shoppers who are increasingly spending their money online, at off-price stores, and on traveling and dining out. The company said last month that sales at its established stores fell 2.1 percent in November and December, which was at the low end of its previous guidance. That decline was despite easy comparisons from the previous holiday period when unseasonably warm weather kept shoppers from splurging on winter apparel. Macy's earnings per share also declined during the fiscal fourth quarter, falling from $2.09 a year earlier. The department store is taking a number of steps to try to restore its prior sales growth and profitability. On the retail side, these initiatives include expanding its Bluemercury and Backstage businesses. The chain is also testing some ways it could reduce its reliance on coupons, which have dented its margins. Hoguet emphasized the company would proceed slowly with any changes to its promotional strategy. As J.C. Penney learned under the leadership of Ron Johnson, moving too quickly away from promotions could alienate discount-seeking shoppers and deliver a blow to the business. ""You will hear more on this subject as we move forward,"" Hoguet said. On the real estate side, Macy's reiterated that it still plans to close another 34 stores or so over the next few years. In January, the company released a list of 68 stores that it plans to close, saying it eventually planned to reach 100. The chain is meanwhile working to boost its value by selling off some of the flagship locations it owns. Macy's has been under pressure from activist investor Starboard to make money off its vast real estate empire. ""I think [Starboard], like our other investors, they want to see our stock price go up. And so do we. We're all aligned in this regard,"" Lundgren told CNBC Tuesday. Adding to uncertainties about the chain, reports surfaced earlier this month saying Hudson's Bay had approached Macy's regarding a takeover. Neither company has confirmed the validity of those reports.  ""You've heard and talked about the rumors of somebody buying us, and you've probably also heard we're buying them,"" Lundgren said. ""What I can tell you is we're going to do the right thing for our shareholders. We're not going to be a highly-leveraged retailer because those movies never turn out well. We've seen that before."" Lundgren will step down March 23 but continue on as executive chairman. He will be succeeded by Jeff Gennette, who was named Macy's president in 2014. During the fiscal year that just kicked off, Macy's projects comparable sales excluding licensed departments will fall between 2.2 percent and 3.3. percent. Analysts had been forecasting a decline of 2.2 percent. However, the department store said it expects sales to decrease between 3.2 percent and 4.3 percent due to store closures. Analysts had been calling for a decline of 4.1 percent.  The company also said it expects adjusted earnings per share to be between $3.37 and $3.62 a share in fiscal 2017, excluding the impact of expected settlement charges related to the company's defined benefit plans. However, when excluding for an expected fourth-quarter gain on the planned sale of the Union Square Men's building in San Francisco and the settlement charges, Macy's should earn between $2.90 and $3.15 a share in fiscal 2017.   In fiscal 2016, Macy's generated $673 million in cash from asset sales, $209 million of which has been booked. Correction: This story has been corrected to reflect Macy's beat analysts' earnings expectations.

ZNGA,Zynga Inc.,2:1. Zume Pizza,None,"Founders: Julia Collins (co-CEO), Alex Garden (co-CEO)Launched: 2015Headquarters: Mountain View, California Funding: $23 million  When you think of pizza, what comes to mind? Sauce? Toppings? Robots? Zume Pizza in Mountain View, California, is thinking about all three. This pizza delivery company, started in 2015, uses a combination of robots and humans to prepare and bake its pizzas, which it then delivers throughout Silicon Valley. Co-founders Julia Collins, who has a background in the restaurant industry, and Alex Garden, the former president of Zynga Studios, believe there are certain repetitive tasks that are best left to bots rather than humans. For example, robots squirt and spread the tomato sauce (more evenly than their human counterparts, apparently) onto the uncooked pies and then transfer them into 800-degree ovens hundreds of times a day. The robots cost between $25,000 and $35,000 each and are made by ABB, a global manufacturer that typically deals with robots for large manufacturing facilities. Of course, if the pizza doesn't taste good, it won't matter who's putting it together. That's why Zume also tries to set itself apart from the competition by emphasizing locally sourced ingredients, fresh filtered water for the dough, and non-GMO flour that it claims makes the pizzas wholesome and delicious. Since its first delivery, in April 2016, the company has sent off more than 15,000 pizzas to Bay Area customers. To decrease customers' wait time, Zume has even created its own special delivery truck with 56 ovens that will finish cooking the pizza during the drive. Far from threatening the jobs of its employees, CEO Collins says the robots help free up human workers to develop new recipes, conduct taste tests and tweak customer service.

FB,"Facebook, Inc.",19:Here's why I'm not buying Snap shares,"Thursday,  2 Mar 2017 | 11:00  AM ET","Today, the NYSE will be decked out in a giant yellow banner announcing the imminent IPO of Snap Inc, parent company of the red hot social media app Snapchat. As an active social media user and an investor, I have a few thoughts I'd like to share. The first is that I will not be a buyer of Snap shares, although I hope the deal trades well and I wish the company and its investors luck. This is the first Tech IPO of 2017, believe it or not, and the first social media IPO since Twitter in 2013. The IPO is priced at $17 per share, slightly above the discussed $14-16 range and the company will be selling 200 million shares to the public. This means they're raising $3.4 billion, which would value the entire company at $23.6 billion. The shares being sold to the public today are ""Class A,"" which sounds good, but in reality, they are all non-voting shares. This means investors are participating in the financial upside of the company but will have no recourse or say in how it's run going forward. The co-founders, Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy, will retain 89% of the voting rights. If you're saying to yourself ""that doesn't sound like a public company at all!"" well, you're right. However, this is merely the latest, most extreme version of a larger anti-democratic trend in which tech firms like Google and Facebook have put shareholder rights behind the autonomy of the founders. More from The Reformed Broker:Chart o' the Day: Longest streak in 53 yearsSnap vs. Facebook vs. Twitter cheatsheetJosh Brown on taking a huge risk with his career—and how it paid off  The argument for this is that people like Zuckerberg and Larry Page should never have to take marching orders from the orcs on Wall Street, people like Carl Icahn and Bill Ackman, who may seek board representation by accumulating large blocks of stock. If you're investing in a technology company, the theory goes, then ostensibly you are betting on the long-term vision of the founder and the last thing you want is a hedge fund demanding a dividend, buyback or a spin-off of an unprofitable unit that may be of some strategic import down the road. My theory is that Silicon Valley execs watched with horror as Icahn tormented eBay board member Marc Andreessen over the spin-off of PayPal while hocking Tim Cook at Apple for more and more return of capital to shareholders. They took a page from the playbook of the family that controls the voting stock in the New York Times and created a second share class. This walled them off from having to be on the receiving end of ""New York money"" and its relentless pursuit of profit today. I should point out that Icahn's agitations at both eBay and Apple haven't worked out poorly for shareholders, overall. So the governance thing is one issue. If you're just a regular shareholder, you have no say anyway, so it may not matter to you. But it could keep institutional investors away from the name, which could in turn affect valuation. But the bigger issue is that I don't think Snap is a particularly well-suited product to be run as a public company. Once you're a traded social media stock, then you have one responsibility that takes precedence over literally everything else, and that responsibility is delivering white-hot, unending, greasy-fast growth metrics in every quarter. Daily and monthly average user growth, new signups, user engagement, timeline views, clicks, shares, likes, faves, dick pics, and on and on. It cannot stop for even a quarter or the narrative changes and the high-multiple stock succumbs to gravity and crashes. The good news for Snap is that it has shown this user growth historically, getting to over 158 million users extraordinarily quickly by year-end 2016, vs 107 million at the end of 2015 . The bad news is that the whole appeal of the site to its core users — the kids who never shut the app off and check in 50 times a day — is the exclusivity of it. Snap works best when you're using it amongst a relatively small group of friends. The network effects of Snap, unlike Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, are approximately zero. You don't ""go viral"" on Snap — but you can do things on Snap that lead to people hearing about offline. It's hard to find people on Snap if they're not already among the contacts in your phone. Discovery favors celeb accounts, big established brands or people you've heard about offline and managed to look up successfully on the app. The best thing about Snap is the chatting itself. People are addicted to chat and Snap is the most visual format for it to date. It bills itself as ""a camera company"" in the prospectus and, in distinction to all of the other social apps, Snap is the only one that opens on the camera screen. It's brilliant. Young people who are snapping themselves all day are not just ""taking selfies,"" they are talking. Facebook's WhatsApp is bigger than Snap, but not necessarily better at this core concept of communicating visually with your friends, as opposed to beginning a conversation with written text. I think there's a lot of room for user growth here. As an individual content creator, however, I think Snap is fairly pointless. When you post there is no public reaction. This is great for highly personal in-jokes among a high school class, for example, or a group of college friends. But it stunts the potential for this to be a major advertising business. Those who have been successful on Snap, like DJ Khaled, are doing meaningless content that's as ephemeral as it should be, given the medium. Barely entertaining, bereft of any discernible point, it merely captures a moment in time visually and then goes away as quickly as it arrived on the screen. ""YO, IM GETTING MY HAIRCUT B! IM WALKING ON A TREADMILL DOG. TREADMILLS ARE A MAJOR KEY! MY HOMIES ARE WASHING MY CAR, BRUH! Cool. The content that does well on Snap is, by definition, disposable. Which is why so much of it is ugly, poorly lit, shaky footage of dogs, people talking into their screen about nothing, hot girls with dogs, cleavage and dogs, bearded dudes with cats, 7 second snippets of conversations that have no context whatsoever, etc. It's mostly sh-- content that you watch once, wonder what you just looked at, and then never see again. Something to scroll through while waiting for your Hot Pocket to finish microwaving or while you're driving down a super-boring highway. Which makes perfect sense — why would you invest time and effort in disappearing content when you can do magical, beautiful stuff on Instagram and it's there forever — a combination scrapbook of your life and portfolio of your artistic expression. The Snapchat Stories feature was meant to broaden the discovery process and to give people a reason to continue posting all the time — the kids call it ""streaking"" or keeping the streak alive. If you post 6 times today, they'll stay threaded in a row of 6 posts in your Snapchat Story for 24 hours. If you stop posting the next day, you have no Story. Exhausting. I have enough futility in my life, don't need another digital boulder to push up a mountainside. The content being created by mainstream brands and media companies is embarrassingly bad. Yes, even what Vice is doing. You watch it and you're like ""What was the point of this?"" All of it could have been done as a YouTube video or a tweet or a Facebook update. They're doing it on Snap, however, because user growth is exploding and there's no reason not to experiment and play where the young people are. That's great, doesn't mean its going to continue forever. Back to Khaled — in the last few weeks, he and several other big content creators on Snap have been using their posts there to encourage followers to also follow them on Instagram. This may just be a blip, but if the marquee users begin migrating their followers elsewhere, it could spook both the ad firms and The Street. Which brings me to my final point: Facebook and its Instagram unit have essentially cloned the best features of Snapchat and Snapchat stories and are gunning disrupt this company out of existence. Zuckerberg was publicly flipped off by Spiegel after a failed attempt at a buyout and ever since he's been attempting to replace it. Instagram Stories are a good start. FB's buying Masquerade, the app that allows you to add funny facial filters like dog noses and rabbit ears and other digital overlays to your photos and videos, was another smart move. Zuck's going to be a grueling competitor for this company — remember, he only did the WhatsApp deal for $19 billion after Spiegel told him to f--- off, and then the details of that conversation came out in the press. Snapchat is not without the means to fight back. It's got the user growth to command some influence among the 5 or 6 advertising firms that direct 90% of all ad spending in this world. It's also been very innovative – in response to the Instagram threat, Snap has created a new feature that allows users to add a post not only to their public Story but to a timeline in which the post can remain forever. But the more features the service adds, the more convoluted the product can become, which can turn off existing users and discourage new users from making it a habit. And, once again, the risk is that Snapchat strays from what made young people like it in the first place – it started as a club where only a select few got the cadence and the unwritten lexicon of the thing. Which is cool. Just not a great business. My last point is that the ad product is immeasurable. There's no link to click or call to action. If you're an ad firm, you have to bend yourself into pretzels to determine whether or not a campaign you're running in Snap is leading to increased something — purchases, signups, etc. This could change, but right now it's even more of a leap of faith than Facebook ads began as. If I tell Budweiser that an advertisement on the center field wall at Yankee Stadium is going to sell more beer, they're probably not going to check to see if that's true. Besides, they don't want Coors to have it anyway. Not sure Snap can pull this sort of argument off forever. I'll end by saying the problems I've listed here are not insurmountable. Spiegel &amp; Co have continuously innovated and user growth has not meaningfully slowed in response to changes in the service so far. Should engagement and new user trends persist, none of what I've mentioned here will stop the ad dollars from flowing. Valuation won't matter either should the user momentum continue, so make sure you ignore anyone talking about it. That's not what is going to make the stock go up or down over the first few years. Finally, if you still feel compelled to own Snap, don't let my pessimism stop you — I am subject to changing my mind in the future. I went from bear to bull on both Facebook and LinkedIn — bought both stocks on the way up after they initially stumbled. And I was dead wrong about Twitter's ability to keep growing and monetizing, having bought it on the day of the IPO and given management way too much rope. So I'm 2 for 3 in the space. Keep in mind that there will be two enormous lockup expirations for Snapchat in the coming months, which may offer better buying opportunities as insider and employee sales hit the tape.

UTX,United Technologies Corporation,11:Trump's TPP pullout could hurt workers more than it helps,"Thursday, 26 Jan 2017 | 12:37  PM ET","  When he signed the executive order formally scrapping a trade deal with 11 Pacific Rim countries, President Donald Trump  proclaimed the move a ""great thing for the American worker.""    But a chorus of trade experts and economists this week have argued that the pulling out of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership will have exactly the opposite impact.    ""Virtually all economic analyses of the proposed TPP … provided empirical arguments that the TPP would raise U.S. workers' income, both for highly educated and less educated workers,"" according to Jeffrey Bergstrand, finance professor at the University of Notre Dame and a former Federal Reserve economist.   Even TPP's most ardent supporters concede that it had flaws; some, for example, argued that it didn't go far enough in protecting intellectual property of U.S. companies, protecting worker rights or cutting red tape that restricts American-made products.     But scrapping the deal outright will leave American workers worse off, according to trade experts like Bergstrand.    Maintaining higher U.S. tariffs on Asian products will increase prices for American consumers, they contend. And without the benefit of lower trade barriers to Asian markets, U.S. companies will have a harder time competing with other countries as they try to boost U.S exports to the rapidly growing TPP economies.     Losing out on that growth potential ""may leave the U.S. economy worse off than it otherwise would have been,"" according to Doug Lippoldt, a trade economist at HSBC Global Research.    Trump's campaign promises to renegotiate or scrap global trade deals like the TPP resonated with American voters based on the president's assertions that free trade has destroyed millions of American jobs and depressed wages.     ""We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs,"" he said in his gloomy Inauguration speech last week.    But simply taking a tough stance on trade won't help Trump fulfill his pledge to create more high-paying factory jobs in the U.S. That's because millions of manufacturing jobs have been lost to automation, not trade deals.     Offshoring once played an important factor. Since manufacturing employment peaked in 1979 at nearly 20 million, some 8 million of those jobs have been lost to automation and cheaper foreign labor markets. Those losses accelerated after the 2001 recession, when competition from China surged, according to MIT researchers, who estimate some 2.0 million to 2.4 million jobs left for China between 1999 and 2011.    But while the level of U.S. manufacturing employment has fallen by roughly a third, overall manufacturing output has doubled, thanks to a surge in productivity brought by increased automation, better supply chain management and other efficiency improvements. Those upgrades aren't going away.     As a result, U.S. manufacturers are able to make more of their product with fewer workers. While improvements in productivity have slowed in recent years, those decades of efficiency upgrades aren't going away.     That means it's unlikely that the U.S. will restore the bulk of lost manufacturing jobs, no matter how many deals Trump can pull off, according to Drew Greenblatt, owner of Baltimore-based Marlin Steel.    Greenblatt had already begun seeing a revival of U.S. manufacturing — even before Trump took office. He's invested heavily in automation, boosting both his company's productivity and the wages of the highly skilled workers who operate that equipment.  For employers like Marlin Steel, that presents a new set of challenges helping to train workers to fill the new high-skilled jobs created by the hoped-for renaissance in U.S. manufacturing. And government, Greenblatt said, needs to play a role.    ""We're going to have to invest in getting our eighth graders and high school grads to do well with math so they can be viable,"" he said. ""We're not going to create the grunt work of yesterday; that's not our future.""   In the meantime, pulling out of the trade deals like the TPP won't stop the ongoing rise in emerging Asian economies and cross-border trade between those countries.     TPP was intended to ensure that the U.S. played an important role in that growth. Now, as the U.S. pulls out of the deal, China is ready with a replacement, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which notably does not include the U.S.     China's readiness to step into the vacuum left by Trump's order to scrap the TPP was underscored recently by Chinese President Xi Jinping in a widely watched address this month at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland    ""Whether you like it or not, the global economy is the big ocean that you cannot escape from."" Xi said in a nearly hourlong speech. ""We will open our arms to the people of other countries and welcome them aboard the express train of China's development.""   In other words, China is ready to keep working to promote global trade even if the U.S. reverses course, according to Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics.     ""Consider the message delivered: Walk away from global trade if you wish, President Trump, but be wary of those who pick up the mantle of leadership as you throw it away,"" Weinberg wrote in a note to clients this week.     So far, Trump's strategy has relied on tweeted threats to slap tariffs on U.S. companies that expand production outside the U.S. and browbeat them on Twitter to build more factories at home.    But as long as U.S. manufacturers can boost output with automation, they may not need more factories to increase output to keep up with demand.     ""When those manufacturing jobs come back, they're going to be different jobs,"" said Greenblatt, ""and there will be less of them because we're so much more productive that we used to be.""    ""You're going to have an American worker making 80 grand a year — one guy running a robot — rather than 10 Chinese workers in a room doing it by hand. We're not going to get the 10 jobs coming back from China.""

IBM,International Business Machines Corporation,"18:IBM CEO: Jobs of the future won't be blue or white collar, they'll be 'new collar'","Tuesday, 17 Jan 2017 | 11:55  AM ET","  Fears that artificial intelligence will steal jobs are largely unfounded, and the technology will instead work cohesively with most professions, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty said Tuesday.    ""It is a partnership between man and machine, if you want to put it that way,"" Rometty said in an interview on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.       ""Think more about activities changing with the technologies. When you do your job, there will be things that take you a lot of time to research and do,"" she said. ""Yes, they'll be done faster. Then you have the time to do what I think we all humans do best.""    At the World Economic Forum. Rometty discussed artificial intelligence alongside Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella  and Joichi Ito, director of MIT's Media Lab.    Artificial intelligence will replace some jobs, but most humans will be working with AI systems, Rometty said. IBM has expanded cognitive computer Watson over the past few years.     ""I am very pleased with the work we are doing with Watson and the scale,"" she said.    Under Rometty, IBM has pledged to hire about 25,000 U.S. workers in the next four years, including 6,000 hires in 2017. But Big Blue has also laid off some workers amid years of restructuring. In its latest annual report, for 2015, IBM said its workforce totaled 377,757, down by 53,455 from 2013.     (IBM told CNBC in a statement that despite the workforce decline from divestitures over the past couple of years, IBM's net employment is up 50,000 over the last decade.)  Rometty said the U.S. is entering into a new era of technology, and with any new era there are bound to be some fears.     ""We've seen it in the past, whether when people come off of doing farming, they had to learn to read. The industrial area, it was mechanical skills,"" she said.    ""If we would change the basis and align what is taught in school with what is needed with business ... that's where I came up with this idea of 'new collar.' Not blue collar or white collar,"" she said.    Rometty's comments come ahead of the company's earnings, expected Thursday. The pressure is on the company to reinvent itself as it has struggled to expand revenue.     ""What we are continuing to do is transform the company,"" Rometty said. ""And that means that there are parts of the business growing, and there are parts of the business — while they are really great businesses to be in — they may not be in growth markets.""

T,AT&T Inc.,"20:CNN spinoff to win Time Warner deal approval makes no sense, AT&T CEO says","Tuesday, 17 Jan 2017 |  6:50  AM ET","  AT&amp;T Chairman and CEO Randall Stephenson told CNBC on Tuesday he sees opposition to the Time Warner  mega-merger fading as the details emerge.    At their meeting last week, Stephenson said he did not talk about the merger with Donald Trump, who expressed opposition to the deal during the campaign.    AT&amp;T's proposed $85 billion purchase of media content powerhouse Time Warner is a ""basic vertical merger,"" Stephenson said on ""Squawk Box"" from the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.    Speculation that AT&amp;T might need to spin off CNN to get the deal through regulators would not be relevant, Stephenson argued, saying such a move would not serve to reduce competition.    ""I don't know why we'd even talk about that,"" he said. ""It doesn't seem relevant to approving a deal like this. What would be the competitive issue that you're remedying with spinning off CNN? There are not competitive issues with owning CNN.""    Time Warner boasts an entertainment portfolio of television networks, including CNN, HBO, TBS and TNT, as well as the Warner Bros. film studio.  AT&amp;T, which in 2015 bought satellite television service DirecTV for $48.5 billion, launched late last year DirecTV Now, the company's skinny bundle of channels delivered over the internet. As for last week's meeting with Trump, Stephenson said the president-elect and he did discuss tax reform, specifically proposals to lower corporate taxes for American corporations.   AT&amp;T would consider increasing capital investment, for such initiatives like fifth-generation wireless technology and laying more fiber cable, if Trump and Republican leaders on Capitol Hill were to lower business taxes, Stephenson said.    ""We spent over the last five years $140 billion"" in the United States, he said. ""We probably would step our capital spending up.""    Another area of discuss with Trump was business regulations, Stephenson said.    ""[Trump] asked me straight up, 'Has this regulatory environment been difficult for you guys.' And I said it's had a huge impact on how we think of investment in the U.S.,"" said Stephenson. ""We talked about what the implications of what streamlining regulation would be.""","[AT, amp, T, Chairman, CEO, Randall, Stephenson, told, CNBC, Tuesday, see, opposition, Time, Warner, mega, merger, fading, detail, emerge, At, AT, amp, T, Chairman, CEO, Randall, Stephenson, told, CNBC, Tuesday, see, opposition, Time, Warner, mega, merger, fading, detail, emerge, At, meeting, Stephenson, see, opposition, Time, Warner, mega, merger, fading, detail, emerge, At, meeting, Stephenson, said, talk, merger, Donald, Trump, expressed, opposition, campaign, AT, amp, T, proposed, purchase, medium, content, powerhouse, Time, Warner, basic, vertical, merger, Stephenson, said, Squawk, Box, sideline, World, Economic, Time, Warner, mega, merger, fading, detail, emerge, At, meeting, Stephenson, said, talk, merger, Donald, Trump, expressed, opposition, campaign, ...]",0.0

On the other hand, Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy for BK Asset Management, thinks that while QQQ may not be a buy right now, investors should be ""very bullish tech going forward."" The recent rise in tech has played a major role in driving the Nasdaq 100 to continuous record highs in the last month, even as the sector initially sat out the postelection rally.

GM,General Motors Company,47:Cramer Remix: The best way to play the oil patch,"Tuesday, 24 Jan 2017 |  7:25  PM ET","  President Trump attempted to fast track the Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines on Tuesday, proving to Jim Cramer that this will be the most pro-petroleum administration in American history.    However, that doesn't mean the price of oil is about to skyrocket.    ""While the oil producers will definitely benefit from deregulation and the approval of new pipelines, the actual outlook for the price of oil is more murky,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.    Ultimately, Cramer likes oil stocks in this environment, but warned that investors need to believe they can do well, even if crude stalls out. His top pick was Magellan Midstream Partners.    ""This is still one more reason why I think the pipelines are the best way to play the oil patch,"" Cramer said.    Cramer also found five themes that can continue to roar higher  and rebuke even the biggest doubters of the rally. They were housing, earnings, deregulation, higher oil, higher rates and the strength in materials stocks.     ""Aside from the deregulation component, most of this rally would have occurred regardless of Trump's initiatives, which means this move might be a lot more sustainable than the doubters would have you believe,"" he said.    D.R. Horton reported strong earnings on Tuesday and confirmed orders were up 15 percent. This matters because mortgage rates went up this quarter too. Typically when rates go up, housing gets hit. Instead, the largest homebuilder had a surprisingly strong level of confidence. Horton even said better employment will lead to better housing demand.  Shares of medical device maker ResMed soared more than 9 percent on Tuesday after reporting a strong quarter, with revenues up 16.7 percent year-over-year.     ResMed sells products to combat sleep apnea and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It makes continuous positive airway pressure machines — known as CPAP machines — that help people with sleep apnea not gasp for air when they sleep.    Cramer spoke with ResMed's CEO Mick Farrell, who said the company intends to use data from more than 1 billion nights of sleep for patients to create actionable information that patients can use to manage their own care, physicians can use to help patients and insurance companies and governments can use for population health management.    ""The opportunities are boundless in what we can do with this,"" Farrell said.    Deluxe Corp has also transitioned into an astounding rebound story. Somehow the century-old payment solutions business best known for printing checks has picked up 25 percent gain in 14 months.    The company's investments in brand awareness to let customers know that they are more than just a check company and were now a one-stop shop for the processes that many small businesses need, have paid off.    It was clear to Cramer that the execution of management was fabulous, too. With the stock at $73, Cramer thinks it is a steal.    ""I believe that small business will be the driver of growth going forward, not the big companies Trump has been meeting with, and Deluxe has solutions that they need in order to expand,"" Cramer said.     Cramer has been a skeptic of the value of unlimited trade for a very, very long time, but says he won't recommend Ford or General Motors if they close their foreign plants.    ""You can't have your protectionist cake and eat it, too. Meaning, when it comes to trade policy there is no scenario where everyone is a winner,"" Cramer said.    President Trump met with major automaker CEOs on Tuesday to urge them to build more plants domestically, saying these plants could ignite economically depressed towns and spur manufacturing in the U.S.    However, if the president only goes after domestic automakers then these companies will be at a disadvantage to the foreign competition who can build cars in places like Mexico. Cramer feared American auto companies could become losers.     In the Lightning Round, Cramer provided his take on a few stocks from callers:    Chesapeake Energy Corporation: ""I like that. They just paid off the preferred, they cleaned up the balance sheet. It's going to be the year of natural gas. I say buy, buy, buy. We were talking about buying that for my charitable trust. You've got a good one.""    Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc: ""I don't like the vaccine business, but more importantly I think that when you are in the crosshairs of the president on this drug issue it doesn't seem to end well."" ","[big, company, Trump, meeting, Deluxe, solution, need, order, expand, Cramer, said, Cramer, skeptic, value, unlimited, trade, time, say, recommend, Ford, General, Motors, foreign, plant, You, protectionist, cake, eat, Meaning, come, trade, policy, scenario, Cramer, said, President, Trump, met, automaker, CEOs, company, Trump, meeting, Deluxe, solution, need, order, expand, Cramer, said, Cramer, skeptic, value, unlimited, trade, time, say, recommend, Ford, General, Motors, foreign, plant, You, protectionist, cake, eat, Meaning, come, trade, policy, scenario, Cramer, said, President, Trump, met, automaker, CEOs, Tuesday]",1.0
JCP,"J.C. Penney Company, Inc. Holding Company",21:Larry McDonald says: 'Get long retail',"Friday, 10 Feb 2017 |  3:35  PM ET","The retail sector has been experiencing a significant slump lately, but for one noted investor it's a great time to get into the space.  A number of retailers dealt with a difficult holiday shopping season that saw giants like Macy's struggle, though the NRF reported that sales were up 4 percent, above estimates of 3.6 percent. There is also concern over a possible border adjustment tax proposed by Republicans that could hit retailers hard. However, Larry McDonald, managing director at ACG Analytics, believes the border adjustment tax will likely be just an ""updated outline"" of what was provided this past summer. ""This Senate is toxic, guys. This tax bill is light-years away from happening, and even when it does happen, let's just say it does pass ... the tax cuts on the individual side and on the corporate side eventually will ... outweigh the border adjustment tax negative on retail,"" he said in an interview with CNBC's ""Halftime Report"" on Friday.

AAL,"American Airlines Group, Inc.",8:Top S&P 500 CEOs weigh in on Trump's effect on business and the economy,"Saturday, 11 Feb 2017 |  5:12  PM ET"," Donald Trump has set the corporate world abuzz. Some companies fear his tweets. Others gleefully anticipate his proposed tax cuts. All of them, it seems, are anxiously waiting to see how the Trump Era affects their bottom lines. To find out about executives' fears and hopes, CNBC reviewed every instance where S&amp;P 500 executives mentioned Trump by name in this quarter's corporate earnings calls — the teleconferences where execs field questions from analysts or reporters. Here are nine especially revealing quotes: ""Several of us in our business were sitting within 30 feet of President Trump when he took his oath of office on the platform last Friday. We all believe, and I mean all of us, that the most overwhelmingly important event geopolitically for the next 50 years is liaison, a constructive liaison between the People's Republic of China and the United States of America. That truth is undeniable. That dynamic is unquestioned."" ""Basically, President Trump recognizes that the F-35 is a very large program, it's the largest program in the Department of Defense. He wants to make sure... that the American taxpayer is getting the lowest possible cost on the program. And we understand his concerns about affordability, we certainly share that ... And it's not about slashing our profit, it's not about our margins when we have those discussions, it's about how do we get the cost of the aircraft down today and in the future. ""Well, first of all, we've obviously been following the Trump administration closely in terms of what you're talking about on tax reform. And it looks like we're going to ... lower the top rate to somewhere around 20 percent, eliminate the deductibility of interest but also provide for immediate expensing of capital. Also provide for a territorial system which is really good news for us because, as you know, we've got about $6 billion in cash sitting overseas that we can bring back to the U.S. very cost-effectively."" ""President Trump's clearly very focused on enacting policies that will grow the U.S. economy and grow American jobs, and we're very supportive of that. So I'm encouraged by his engagement. His approach to engaging business, having an open dialogue, discussing the issues, finding solutions, finding ways to grow U.S. manufacturing jobs I think are all very positive. And that engagement is a productive approach. We welcome it. We've got a voice at the table."" ""President Trump's focus of enhancing the ability for manufacturing industries to thrive and produce jobs, well, that's AEP's service territory. His focus on a balanced portfolio of energy resources, including fossil fuels, that's also AEP's service territory. So as I said before the election, whether focused on the Clean Power Plan as in Hillary Clinton's proposals or President Trump's proposals, AEP should prosper..."" ""First, in an overall sense, I've been very pleased with the agenda that the Trump administration has. We have seen an avalanche of regulation over the last decade, and putting a much more balanced cost/benefit framework in place to assess the value of those regulations, freeing up infrastructure pipelines, all of that is quite positive for our business, for the country, job creation, and a lot of things. So that is very much a positive."" We are ""very encouraged by their discussion about a strong infrastructure bill. Both President Trump and (Democratic) Senator (Sherrod) Brown are speaking about something significant in the neighborhood of about $1 trillion dollars over the next 10 years. That has a significant impact on steel consumption."" I also think what's interesting for 2017 is ... some of the European elections that we're going to see in 2017. As you know, we get a tremendous amount of revenue coming out of Europe. And that is something that, with the elections coming up, I believe in Germany and France this year both, it could be another volatile situation. I'm not saying it's going to be the same as when President Trump was elected, but that's something that we could look at. So I think geopolitical volatility could be definitely in the mix...""

Time Inc. — The magazine publisher fell 3 cents a share short of estimates, with quarterly profit of 75 cents per share. Revenue missed expectations, as well. The company was hurt by a decline in ad sales, although digital ad revenue did increase substantially. Alexion Pharmaceuticals — The drugmaker earned an adjusted $1.26 per share for its latest quarter, a penny a share above estimates. Revenue fell short of Street forecasts, however, and the company gave a lower-than-expected 2017 earnings outlook as sales of its flagship blood disorder drug Soliris fall. Avon Products — The cosmetics maker fell 8 cents a share short of estimates, with adjusted quarterly profit of 1 cent per share. Revenue also missed estimates, as sales were lower in most of its global markets. GNC Holdings — The nutritional supplements retailer earned an adjusted 7 cents per share for its latest quarter, well short of the 36 cent a share consensus estimate. Revenue also missed, and GNC announced it was suspending its quarterly dividend. The company noted, however, that its results do not yet reflect the recent overhaul of its business model. Tempur Sealy — The mattress retailer came in 5 cents a share above estimates, with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.18 per share. Revenue also topped Street forecasts. The company said worldwide demand for its products is ""solid."" Cisco Systems — The networking equipment maker reported adjusted quarterly profit of 57 cents per share, 1 cent a share above estimates. Revenue was essentially in line with forecasts. Cisco's results got a boost from strong sales of its security-related offerings. CBS — CBS came in a penny a share above estimates, with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.11 per share. Ad revenue dropped nearly 3 percent as the network broadcast fewer NFL games, though the number was aided by political spending. TripAdvisor — TripAdvisor fell 15 cents a share shy of estimates, with adjusted quarterly profit of 16 cents per share. The travel review website operator also saw revenue fall short of Street forecasts. TripAdvisor reported a drop in both subscription revenue and in display ad spending. Applied Materials — Applied Materials posted adjusted quarterly profit of 67 cents per share, 1 cent a share above estimates.

The data storage company gave strong current-quarter guidance, as well. Molina Healthcare — Molina lost $1.54 per share for its latest quarter, compared to consensus estimates of a 75 cents per share of profit. The health insurer also saw revenue miss forecasts, as did its full-year 2017 outlook. Molina, which focuses on the Medicaid market, blamed challenges stemming from the Affordable Care Act. McDonald's — The restaurant chain is the target of a complaint by a Chinese consultancy, which says the company's sale of its China-based business may hurt workers and consumers. The complaint comes from Hejun Vanguard Group, which was instrumental in winning antitrust disputes with both Coca-Cola and Apple. Boeing — Boeing workers in South Carolina voted against union representation by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.

CSCO,"Cisco Systems, Inc.",10:Cramer's charts discover 3 old-school tech plays with plenty of upside,"Tuesday,  7 Feb 2017 |  6:46  PM ET","Some of the younger technology stocks were red-hot on Tuesday, but Jim Cramer said some of the old-school tech plays still have life in them. ""These old tech stocks may lack the sex appeal of the cloud, mobile, social and artificial intelligence names, but the charts of Cisco, Jabil Circuit and Oracle look good,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. To figure out what the charts predict for these stocks he spoke with Tim Collins, a technician and colleague of Cramer's at RealMoney.com. Networking equipment giant Cisco is set to report earnings next week, and Collins thinks it could be a high-risk high-reward situation if investors buy the stock ahead of the quarter. Collins found a solid floor of support for the stock at $29 and a ceiling of resistance at $31.50.  Collins expects the stock to either break out to the upside or break down. If the stock can push past above $29, he thinks it could be smooth sailing to $34 or $35. If it pulls below $29, he recommended selling it instead of waiting for a potential breakdown. He also looked at the Chandelier Exit, a volatility-based tool that helps technicians figure out when to ride out a trend and when to sell. Collins found that Cisco is standing above the warning lines on the Chandelier, which suggested that the stock could have more room to run. Electronic manufacturer Jabil Circuit has been consolidating after a big move and Collins spotted a cup-and-handle formation, which is one of the most reliably bullish indicators out there. Collins believes that if Jabil can make its way a bit higher and close around $24.50, the next stop could be $27.50 or $30 by the end of 2017. However, he said to be concerned if the stock falls below $21.50. The last chart Collins looked at was for Oracle, which surprisingly had the strongest trend of all three old-school tech names. He thinks it could be ready for a powerful break out of its $40 ceiling if resistance that has held it back. Ideally, Collins would like to see Oracle close above $40.50, which would indicate an all clear trigger to buy the stock. He thinks he could rally up to $43.50 with a possibility of going to $45. The one caveat is that Oracle has been a tough stock to own whenever it trades below its 40-week moving average, thus Collins advised to be wary if it pulls back below this key level. Ultimately, Collins found that Cisco, Jabil and Oracle all have strong charts right now. ""I wouldn't be surprised if he is right that they have got more upside here,"" Cramer said.

JHI,John Hancock Investors Trust,,,,,
CHKP,Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.,1:Cramer Remix: The one word that can doom retailers,"Tuesday,  7 Feb 2017 |  7:07  PM ET","If there is one lesson Jim Cramer has learned this time around in earnings season, it is that retail cannot be held hostage by the shopping mall. This became blatantly obvious to Cramer when Michael Kors reported what looked like good numbers on the surface, but when he dug deeper, he realized weak department store traffic led to a negative quarter and weak forecast. ""The conference call took my breath away,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. Newell Brands, which sells lots of products in stores like Target, also said the mall was a challenge. ""It has gotten to the point where even mentioning the mall on a conference call is the kiss of death. They are dying shrines to spending the old way,"" Cramer said. As the criticisms of President Donald Trump's approach continue to pile up, Cramer reminded investors that the recent strength in the stock market is not because of Trump. Instead, it is based on earnings and the belief that companies can do even better. ""There is a lot of raw emotion when it comes to Trump and when people get emotional, even really smart professional money managers, they stop being able to analyze the situation objectively,"" Cramer said. There may be a correction one day, and Cramer recommended maybe investors should raise cash for that event. Maybe the president will tell the Chinese he is done tomorrow and they can't sell in the U.S. anymore. That could cause a crash, Cramer said. Or maybe Trump calls for a Chinese boycott. That would bring down earnings. ""As far as I'm concerned, things are better and that, not Trump, might be the real secret sauce behind this extraordinary and very real rally,"" Cramer said. Shares of Centene soared more than 5 percent on Tuesday after reporting a strong quarter, including revenue up 89 percent year-over-year, and robust full-year guidance for 2017. Centene is a healthcare provider that specializes in government-sponsored programs like Medicaid and Medicare. The company has done well under the Affordable Care Act, because the law included an expansion to Medicaid, which meant more business for Centene. As the healthcare environment becomes murky amid Trump's agenda to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, Cramer spoke with Centene's CEO Michael Neidorff who said it could take years for that to happen. ""I have said all along that it is business as usual. We have insisted on continuing to do our thing the way we do it and it is working out very well. In fact, we told the Street today in our call that we actually have over $400 million that we will be paying back in on the risk adjuster this year,"" Neidorff said. Cramer has been puzzled by cybersecurity lately. Even though hackers were in the headlines constantly with one attack after another, cybersecurity stocks barely moved. By the end of the year, the Purefunds ISE Cybersecurity ETF, with ticker HACK, finished the year up only 2 percent. That dramatically lagged the 9.5 percent gain of the S&amp;P 500. However, so far this year HACK has come alive and is now up 8 percent. Cramer thinks the theme is here to stay, as businesses and governments need to keep spending to prevent data breaches. Cramer's top picks in the group were Check Point, Cyberark and Palo Alto Networks, in that order. Some of the younger technology stocks were red-hot on Tuesday, but Cramer said some of the old-school tech plays still have life in them. ""These old tech stocks may lack the sex appeal of the cloud, mobile, social and artificial intelligence names, but the charts of Cisco, Jabil Circuit and Oracle look good,"" Cramer said. To figure out what the charts predict for these stocks he spoke with Tim Collins, a technician and colleague of Cramer's at RealMoney.com. One chart Collins looked at was for Oracle, which surprisingly had the strongest trend of all three old-school tech names. He thinks it could be ready for a powerful break out of its $40 ceiling if resistance that has held it back. Ideally, Collins would like to see Oracle close above $40.50, which would indicate an all-clear trigger to buy the stock. He thinks he could rally up to $43.50 with a possibility of going to $45. In the Lightning Round, Cramer gave his take on a few stocks from callers: Barclays: ""I think there is more [of a gain]. I like these European banks. By the way, don't forget, my new favorite spec is Banco Santander.""  Express Scripts: ""Too risky. I like UnitedHealth in that group. That is my play, I am not deveating from it. I don't need to go down. I know Cardinal had a good number today, and god bless them. UnitedHealth.""","[analyze, situation, objectively, Cramer, said, There, correction, Cramer, recommended, maybe, investor, raise, event, Maybe, president, tell, Chinese, done, tomorrow, U, S, anymore, That, cause, crash, Cramer, said, Or, maybe, Trump, call, Chinese, boycott, That, bring, earnings, As, far, I, concerned, constantly, attack, cybersecurity, barely, moved, By, end, Purefunds, ISE, Cybersecurity, ETF, ticker, HACK, finished, percent, That, dramatically, lagged, percent, gain, S, amp, P, However, far, HACK, come, alive, percent, Cramer, think, theme, stay, business, government, need, keep, spending, prevent, data, cybersecurity, barely, moved, By, end, Purefunds, ISE, Cybersecurity, ETF, ticker, HACK, finished, percent, That, dramatically, lagged, percent, gain, S, amp, ...]",1.0

MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,40:What Wall Street wants from Microsoft earnings,"Wednesday, 25 Jan 2017 | 10:03  AM ET","  Wall Street expects Microsoft to report solid earnings and continued cloud growth when it reports quarterly results after the close of trading Thursday.    Analysts expect the world's biggest software company to post earnings of 79 cents per share on revenue of $25.28 billion for the December quarter, according to Thomson Reuters.     Investors are particularly focused on how fast Microsoft is growing its higher margin cloud offerings — including cloud computing platform Azure and its web-based suite of productivity programs Office 365 — while controlling costs.    ""It all boils down to is the Azure business growing and growing profitably,"" said Stifel analyst Brad Reback. ""If Azure is the growth engine we think it is and can pick up market share from AWS, then the company is well positioned for the next couple of decades.""  (Reback has a Buy rating on the stock and a $66 price target.)    Microsoft began reporting commercial cloud gross margins for the first time last quarter — to add more transparency to its business — and this metric will continue to be important to investors, he said. Last quarter, Microsoft reported a commercial cloud gross margin 49 percent, up from 42 percent in the prior quarter.   Though Amazon's AWS is clearly in the lead today, Microsoft's Azure is quickly closing the gap, said PiperJaffray analyst Alex Zukin. Azure's core functions are finally comparable to AWS's and Microsoft's customer support, existing relationships and contract flexibility make Azure particularly appealing to many businesses, he said. Azure is doing well in the retail sector as retailers are wary of sharing their data with Amazon or funding a competitor, he said.   ""This is an extremely large market and its turning into a duopoly where the majority of vendors are going to pick AWS or Azure,"" he said. Zurkin rates the stock a ""Buy"" with an $80 price target.    The company is also expected to announce job cuts as part of a previously announced plan to cut 2,850 jobs by June 2017. The December quarter was the last quarter to suffer ""meaningful overhang"" from the Nokia deal Microsoft has been working to unwind, said Reback.     With so many moving parts of the business, analysts will be listening closely for commentary and any additional metrics executives may share on the earnings conference call on Thursday at 2.30 p.m. Pacific.     Analysts expect Microsoft to return to robust revenue growth — reversing two years of declines — next quarter. That's also when the company will begin to fold in LinkedIn's contribution to its earnings, after closing the deal to acquire the company for $26.2 billion on December 8, 2016. Analysts credit CEO Satya Nadella for leading the company through its transition from legacy businesses to new high growth cloud businesses. Most analysts who cover the stock — 69 percent — recommend buying it, according to data compiled by Factset.    ""He's done a phenomenal job — think about the sentiment now versus four years ago — it's astounding,"" said Reback ""It's like [Louis] Gerstner's turnaround of IBM without the near-death experience.""

DIS,Walt Disney Company (The),"15:Early movers: DIS, MDLZ, CTSH, ALK, HUM, TIME, TWX & more","Wednesday,  8 Feb 2017 |  8:01  AM ET","Check out which companies are making headlines before the bell:  Walt Disney — Disney reported adjusted quarterly profit of $1.55 per share, 6 cents a share above estimates. Revenue, however, came in below forecasts, led by a drop in advertising revenue and tougher comparisons in the movie business. Separately, CEO Robert Iger said he was open to extending his term on the job beyond his scheduled retirement in 16 months. Mondelez International — Mondelez came in a penny a share below estimates, with adjusted quarterly profit of 47 cents per share. Revenue for the snack maker was slightly below Street forecasts. CEO Irene Rosenfeld said results were impacted by a number of short-term issues, as well as weakness in its business abroad. Cognizant Technology — The IT services provider reported adjusted quarterly profit of 87 cents per share, 1 cent a share above estimates. Revenue came in just below forecasts. Separately, the company struck an agreement with activist investor Elliott Management, appointing three directors and returning $3.4 billion to shareholders. Alaska Air — The fifth-largest U.S. carrier beat estimates by 16 cents a share, with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.56 per share. Revenue beat forecasts and the company also increased its quarterly dividend to 30 cents per share from 27-1/2 cents. Humana — The health insurer earned an adjusted $2.09 per share for its latest quarter, while revenue was slightly below projections. Humana said that it added members in its Medicare Advantage business, and that it would give an update on its transaction to be bought by Aetna by February 16. That deal was blocked in a court ruling last month. Time Inc.  — Meredith Corp. and an investor group led by Edgar Bronfman Jr. have pushed ahead with their pursuit of the publisher of Sports Illustrated, Fortune, and People, according to The Wall Street Journal. Time Warner — The media company beat estimates by 6 cents a share, with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.25 per share. Revenue also beat forecasts. The results were helped by the success of the Harry Potter spin-off movie ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them."" Time Warner also said it still expected its deal to be bought by AT&amp;T to close later this year. Allergan — The drugmaker earned an adjusted $3.90 per share for its latest quarter, beating estimates of $3.76 a share. Its revenue also came in above forecasts on increased sales of Botox and other therapeutic treatments. Twitter — Twitter was upgraded to ""buy"" from ""neutral"" at BTIG, which notes an acceleration in daily active users. BTIG said that is especially true in the United States, which has a disproportionate impact on the company's revenue and profits. Gilead Sciences — Gilead beat Street forecasts by 9 cents a share, with adjusted quarterly profit of $2.70 per share. The drugmaker's revenue also beat estimates. Gilead's results were led by sales of its hepatitis C drugs, but the company did give a lower than expected forecast for sales of those treatments for the full year. Separately, the company announced a 10 percent dividend increase. Zillow — Zillow reported quarterly profit of 14 cents per share, 3 cents a share above estimates. Revenue also beat forecasts. The online real estate website operator's better-than-expected performance came despite a 20 percent drop in display advertising revenue, with the company saying the drop is a result of de-emphasizing display ads and improving the user experience. Twilio — Twilio broke even for its latest quarter on an adjusted basis, compared to an expected loss of 5 cents per share. The communications technology company saw revenue also beat estimates, and the breakeven quarter on the bottom line was Twilio's first since going public last year. Buffalo Wild Wings — Buffalo Wild Wings missed estimates by 40 cents a share, reporting a quarterly profit of 87 cents per share. The restaurant chain's revenue was well below forecasts, as well. It also gave a worse-than-expected outlook for the current year, seeing comparable sales growth of 1 to 2 percent. Panera Bread — Panera reported adjusted quarterly profit of $2.05 per share, 5 cents a share above estimates, despite a small miss on the top line. The restaurant chain's bottom-line results are being helped by the upgrades in its restaurants, as well as higher prices. Yum China — The company more than doubled the 8 cent a share consensus estimate, with adjusted quarterly profit of 17 cents per share. The restaurant chain's revenue did come in below forecasts. This was Yum China's first report as a standalone public company following its spin-off from Yum Brands. The company also announced a $300 million stock buyback. Sanofi — Sanofi said its full-year 2017 earnings would be stable to slightly lower than it saw in 2016. The drugmaker also said it was in no hurry to do any deals, after losing out in its bid to buy Switzerland's Actelion. Rio Tinto — Rio beat profit forecasts with its latest quarterly report. The mining company also declared a bigger-than-expected dividend, as well as a stock buyback. Syngenta — Syngenta said it expected its $43 billion deal to buy ChemChina to close during this year's second quarter, as the agriculture chemical maker makes progress in clearing regulatory hurdles. IntercontinentalExchange — ICE said the Securities and Exchange Commission may bring an enforcement action against its New York Stock Exchange branch over a July 2015 glitch that halted trading for nearly four hours. Alphabet — The company's Google unit has reportedly struck a deal with Walt Disney to license ESPN, ABC, and other networks for display on Google's YouTube streaming operation, according to The Wall Street Journal.","[Check, company, making, headline, Walt, Disney, Disney, reported, adjusted, profit, share, cent, share, estimate, Revenue, came, forecast, led, drop, advertising, revenue, tougher, comparison, movie, Check, company, making, headline, Walt, Disney, Disney, reported, adjusted, profit, share, cent, share, estimate, Revenue, came, forecast, led, drop, advertising, revenue, tougher, comparison, movie, business, Check, company, making, headline, Walt, Disney, Disney, reported, adjusted, profit, share, cent, share, estimate, Revenue, came, forecast, led, drop, advertising, revenue, tougher, comparison, movie, business, Separately, Revenue, snack, maker, slightly, Street, forecast, CEO, Irene, Rosenfeld, said, result, impacted, number, term, issue, weakness, business, abroad, Cognizant, Technology, The, IT, service, provider, reported, ...]",1.0

SBUX,Starbucks Corporation,18:Starbucks says that crowd of people waiting for their Frappuccinos is hurting sales,"Thursday, 26 Jan 2017 |  6:19  PM ET","  Mobile pay is speeding Starbucks customers through the checkout line, but a bottleneck is building for the baristas.    The company has seen mobile order and pay transactions spike throughout its U.S. stores, with 1,200 of its stores experiencing a 20 percent jump in mobile pay and ordering during peak hours.  While these transactions are a boon for the coffee giant, the increase in volume has hurt same-store sales. That's because congestion at the hand-off counter has caused incoming customers to leave without making a purchase, despite lines at the register being short, said Kevin Johnson, Starbucks' president and soon-to-be CEO, during an earnings conference call.    Johnson said that this was a contributing factor in the company's lower-than-expected same-store sales growth during the fiscal first quarter. The coffee giant reported that same-store sales only grew 3 percent, short of Wall Street's anticipated growth of 3.8 percent.    In the previous year, the increase in mobile pay orders only affected about 600 stores.    Starbucks managers across the U.S. have designed their own solutions to this bottlenecking by employing additional staff members, redeploying already hired employees and adding mobile kiosks designed specifically for customers who used the company's mobile pay and ordering.     CEO Howard Schultz said that several Starbucks designers are in Seattle this week working on plans for future Reserve stores and bars and will also tackle this congestion issue. He noted that the company will look to redesign future stores and remodel older shops to adapt to this new payment structure.    Mobile pay and ordering is ""a significant part of the morning business,"" Schultz noted during the earnings call. The company also said mobile alerts could be used to alleviate overcrowding.

But what the president may not realize is that he's likely to give the upscale department store chain a giant boost with his upcoming tax reform plan.  Nordstrom initially sold off after Trump's tweet, however the shares recovered their losses and closed up 4 percent Wednesday.

SHLD,Sears Holdings Corporation,5:US retail sales rose 0.4% in Jan vs 0.1% increase expected,"Wednesday, 15 Feb 2017 |  9:21  AM ET","U.S. retail sales rose more than expected in January as households bought electronics and a range of other goods, pointing to sustained domestic demand that should bolster economic growth in the first quarter. The Commerce Department said on Wednesday retail sales increased 0.4 percent last month. December's retail sales were revised up to show a 1.0 percent rise instead of the previously reported 0.6 percent advance. Last month's fairly upbeat sales came despite motor vehicle purchases recording their biggest drop in 10 months. Compared to January last year retail sales were up 5.6 percent. Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales increased 0.4 percent after an upwardly revised 0.4 percent gain in December. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales ticking up 0.1 percent and core sales gaining 0.3 percent last month. January's fairly solid retail sales supported views that economic growth will accelerate in the first quarter. The economy grew at a 1.9 percent annualized rate in the fourthquarter. Consumer spending is being supported by a tightening labor market, which is gradually boosting wage growth. That in turn is underpinning economic growth, paving the way for at least two interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve this year. Fed Chair Janet Yellen told lawmakers on Tuesday that ""waiting too long to remove accommodation would be unwise."" The U.S. central bank has forecast three rate increases this year. The Fed hiked its overnight interest rate last December by 25 basis points to a range of 0.50 percent to 0.75 percent. Last month, sales at electronics and appliances stores jumped 1.6 percent, the biggest rise since June 2015, after falling 1.1 percent in December. Receipts at building material stores increased 0.3 percent. Sales at clothing stores jumped 1.0 percent, the largest rise in nearly a year. Department store sales climbed 1.2 percent, the biggest increase since December 2015. Department store sales have been undercut by online retailers, led by Amazon.com. That has led to some retailers, including Macy's, Sears, and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch announcing shop closures.

UTX,United Technologies Corporation,10:Trump appears to be inching closer to backing GOP's complex border adjustment tax,"Thursday, 26 Jan 2017 |  7:17  PM ET","  President  Donald Trump appears to be inching closer to endorsing a border adjustment tax that stands as a cornerstone of the House GOP's plans for corporate tax reform.     On Thursday, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer caused a stir when he suggested that the U.S. could impose a 20 percent tax on Mexican goods, as part of one possibility to pay for Trump's proposed border wall. The wall proposal created a diplomatic firestorm, and caused Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to pull out of a meeting with Trump next week.    The description by Spicer was cloaked in protectionist terms, and described as a 20 percent border tax on Mexico. Although his remarks were interpreted by some as a border tax, the proposal outlined by the White House spokesman actually echoes a plan floated by House Speaker Paul Ryan—which would suggest a border adjustment tax that differs from an ordinary tariff.     Currently, U.S. corporations are taxed on their worldwide profits at 35 percent, but the proposed Congressional Republican plan would change that radically.     The new tax formula would tax domestic revenue (minus domestic costs) at a much lower rate of 20 percent. The net effect would be one that favors exports over imports.    The idea is controversial among retailers, because large shares of their products are imported.     When asked by CNBC about Spicer's comments, AshLee Strong, a spokesperson for Ryan, said that ""We have been and continue to be on the same page about tax reform that supports American jobs and American goods.""

ANF,Abercrombie & Fitch Company,4:US retail sales rose 0.4% in Jan vs 0.1% increase expected,"Wednesday, 15 Feb 2017 |  9:21  AM ET","U.S. retail sales rose more than expected in January as households bought electronics and a range of other goods, pointing to sustained domestic demand that should bolster economic growth in the first quarter. The Commerce Department said on Wednesday retail sales increased 0.4 percent last month. December's retail sales were revised up to show a 1.0 percent rise instead of the previously reported 0.6 percent advance. Last month's fairly upbeat sales came despite motor vehicle purchases recording their biggest drop in 10 months. Compared to January last year retail sales were up 5.6 percent. Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales increased 0.4 percent after an upwardly revised 0.4 percent gain in December. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales ticking up 0.1 percent and core sales gaining 0.3 percent last month. January's fairly solid retail sales supported views that economic growth will accelerate in the first quarter. The economy grew at a 1.9 percent annualized rate in the fourthquarter. Consumer spending is being supported by a tightening labor market, which is gradually boosting wage growth. That in turn is underpinning economic growth, paving the way for at least two interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve this year. Fed Chair Janet Yellen told lawmakers on Tuesday that ""waiting too long to remove accommodation would be unwise."" The U.S. central bank has forecast three rate increases this year. The Fed hiked its overnight interest rate last December by 25 basis points to a range of 0.50 percent to 0.75 percent. Last month, sales at electronics and appliances stores jumped 1.6 percent, the biggest rise since June 2015, after falling 1.1 percent in December. Receipts at building material stores increased 0.3 percent. Sales at clothing stores jumped 1.0 percent, the largest rise in nearly a year. Department store sales climbed 1.2 percent, the biggest increase since December 2015. Department store sales have been undercut by online retailers, led by Amazon.com. That has led to some retailers, including Macy's, Sears, and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch announcing shop closures. Sales at online retailers were unchanged last month after soaring 1.9 percent in December. Receipts at restaurants and bars rose 1.4 percent, while sales at sporting goods and hobby stores shot up 1.8 percent.

STX,Seagate Technology PLC,1:Cramer says to 'ride the tiger' for these technology stocks in the sweet spot,"Wednesday, 25 Jan 2017 |  7:05  PM ET","  Jim Cramer is bringing back the tried and true method of ""riding the tiger"" for Micron, Seagate and Western Digital.  The phrase ""Riding the tiger"" refers to investors buying a wild, fast and ferocious stock— riding it until they get to where they need to go, then selling it before they get bitten.    ""Few stocks embody that wild ride better than the commodity semiconductor names and disk drive makers,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.    These stocks tend to be the biggest boom and bust stocks on the market, with dramatic moves up and down.   Micron is a textbook boom and bust case as every few years it is the best performer of the S&amp;P 500 Index, and then it becomes the worst performer.  Micron is known for dynamic random access memory (DRAMs), which are the most basic commodity used as memory in many PCs. Periodically a tightness of supply occurs, so the company can raise prices, and the stock soars.    Eventually prices get so high that Micron's competitors jump in and flood the market with supply. Suddenly, DRAMs are a lot less profitable, and Micron's stock goes lower.    ""If you are riding the tiger, you need to know to get off it long before those new foundries start producing DRAMs,"" Cramer said.    That was exactly why Micron moved into flash memory, because it isn't as competitive. However, Western Digital's CEO Steve Milligan recently told Cramer that flash pricing has become better, allowing profits to fall to the bottom line.     Western Digital and Micron are now reaping the benefits.    Pure disk driver maker Seagate roared 13 percent on Tuesday after reporting a strong quarter. It confirmed that business has suddenly exploded because of new uses for large scale disk drives.    So, with DRAMs, Flask and disk drives all better than expected, Cramer said they are ready to run.    ""When these cycles are in the sweet spot, as they are now, you are riding a turbo-charged tiger. It doesn't matter who is president, as long as there is no new capacity, these stocks will keep roaring,"" Cramer said.    Questions for Cramer?

GOOGL,Alphabet Inc.,17:Cramer’s Snap IPO playbook: How to make the most of a ‘phenomenal trade’,"Tuesday, 28 Feb 2017 |  6:37  PM ET","As the market eagerly awaits the IPO of Snap, the parent company of the popular Snapchat app, Jim Cramer reviewed his playbook for investors to make a move at the right time. ""I totally get where the bears are coming from, but I believe that, at least initially, the bulls are going to triumph here, and they could potentially keep winning for a whole lot longer than that,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. A typical daily average user of Snapchat visits the app more than 18 times a day for about 20 to 30 minutes of total activity. With the astounding 158 million people that use Snapchat, there are more than 2.5 billion snaps a day. According to Snapchat, the average user age ranges from 18 to 34 years old. Watch the full segment here: Last year, Snapchat's revenue growth increased by an astounding 589 percent, though the company is still not yet profitable. Its daily active user base rose to 158 million in the latest quarter, up from 107 million the year before, although the growth has decelerated a bit in the past couple of quarters. The slowing user growth could potentially be a real issue, Cramer said. Last summer, Facebook's Instagram launched its own Instagram stories platform, which appeared to be a knock-off of Snapchat. Cramer attributed this as the reason why Snap's daily active user base increased by just 10 percent in the first half of 2016 to the second half, compared to 33 percent in the previous six months. The other reason for deceleration was due to performance issues on Android phones. Another possible problem that Cramer uncovered is the immense amount of spending that Snap is doing on cloud-hosting costs. In the next five years, it expects to spend $400 million annually on Google Cloud and another $200 million annually on Amazon Web Services. Meanwhile, Snap only expects to hit $1 billion in ad revenue this year. This means at least 60 percent of that will be eaten up by hosting costs. ""Nevertheless, I think the good absolutely outweighs the bad here, at least for the near- and intermediate-term future,"" Cramer said. While Snap's user growth is still impressive, it has plenty of opportunity to expand internationally. Any company with the immense amount of revenue growth must be doing something very right, Cramer said. Additionally, Goldman Sachs is one of the underwriters of the IPO and estimates that Snap could hit approximately $2 billion in revenue by 2018. Even better, Snap could be a great investment if it uses the billions they expect to raise in the IPO to expand new lines of business, and those businesses are successful. Regardless of the long term, Cramer expects Snap to be a ""phenomenal trade"" and its stock to soar when it comes public. Snap is also coming public about a year earlier into its cycle than Twitter did, which means investors can tap into the juicy early-stage growth. ""If Snap spikes really hard right out of the gate, I suggest waiting for a pullback before you buy or accepting that you missed it if the stock is more than doubled at the opening,"" Cramer said. Ultimately, Snap is expected to price on Wednesday within an expected range of $17 to $18, which would put its market cap at $20 billion. Based on that IPO price, Snap would trade at 20.3 times this year's sales, which sounded expensive initially to Cramer, but compared to Facebook's 19.4 times sales when it came public, it's not exactly uncharted territory. ""I could see it doubling pretty easily simply because big firms that got a huge slug of stock in the deal will go into the regular market to buy more, so their cost basis will be superb versus the actual closing price,"" Cramer said.

""The market has rewarded the stocks very well in the fourth quarter,"" said Ken Leon, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research. ""The question is, can they really catch up with the euphoria of having a Trump administration?""    The fourth-quarter reporting season kicks off in earnest Friday with results from BlackRock, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and PNC Financial. Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs report early next week after Monday's Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.    The bank stocks are a key part of the U.S. market's rally to record highs. The SPDR S&amp;P Bank ETF (KBE) has shot up more than 24 percent since the election, while the broader financials sector is up 17 percent as the top performer in the S&amp;P 500 over that time.     As a result, expectations are generally elevated.     Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg said in a Wednesday note that most of the large banks it covers should beat consensus earnings estimates. That's despite a history of fourth-quarter numbers disappointing, Goldberg said.     ""I don't think there's a lot of room for shortfall, assuming we don't get a surprise,"" said Devin Ryan, analyst at JMP Securities. ""We're going to be focusing more on incremental comments from management that suggest the backdrop is changing.""   Investors may not hear as much optimism on potential political changes as they would like. While the bank stocks have rallied early this year to highs not seen since the 2008 financial crisis, not many expect the complete repeal of the post-crisis Dodd-Frank legislation as Trump has promised.     ""They're probably going to be slower than maybe the market has anticipated. We don't view financial regulation as a top priority for the new administration,"" said Shannon Stemm, financial services analyst at Edward Jones.     In his first news conference since the election Wednesday, Trump did not discuss tax reform or deregulation.     Wells Fargo will take its own place in the spotlight for its second earnings report since a phony bank accounts scandal came to light. Friday's report will mark the first full quarter with Tim Sloan as president and CEO, after the abrupt departure of John Stumpf as chairman and CEO just days before Wells Fargo's third-quarter report in October.    ""I think there are going to be a lot of questions asked,"" said Cathy Seifert, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research. ""We're going to have to hear from them how what they're doing to resolve that and further issues like that.""     — CNBC's Chris Hayes contributed to this report.

V,Visa Inc.,1:Cramer spells out why you would be a fool to bet against the market now,"Wednesday, 22 Feb 2017 |  6:13  PM ET","Jim Cramer knows a sell-off is inevitable in the market eventually. But right now, he says stocks are rallying because of real reasons that could mean stocks are still undervalued. ""Companies keep beating the earnings estimates and raising their forecasts, rendering the current price-to-earnings multiples pretty much worthless,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. Cramer wasn't rationalizing reasons to buy. The simple fact is that if companies can keep delivering better earnings than expected, then maybe the market is cheaper than investors realize. Both Home Depot and Wal-Mart delivered surprisingly strong quarters this week. The retailers' stocks appeared to be overvalued to Cramer until he heard their earnings calls. Afterwards, their valuations were more reasonable. Both gave analysts ample opportunity to raise estimates. ﻿Watch the full segment here: The same thing happened with Cisco Systems last week and Visa earlier in the month. Based on the previous quarter, Cramer was ready for downbeat numbers from Cisco. Instead, through big contract wins and positive acquisitions, Cisco went from being a potentially expensive stock to being ridiculously cheap after reporting a transformative quarter. Visa's last quarter was a bit weaker than Cramer expected, and he thought there would be a repeat situation. Instead, Visa had acceleration in almost every venue that its business touches in the past few months. Cramer quickly realized that Visa's stock was cheap coming out of the quarter. ""It is not just earnings that is making it hard to bet against this market,"" Cramer said. Activist investor Nelson Peltz's Trian Partners announced a large position in slow-growing Procter &amp; Gamble recently, in a move that would typically lead to higher prices. Cramer found Peltz to be the one activist where if investors bought a position after he announced a new position, they could still consistently beat the market. Likewise, Carl Icahn took a large stake in Bristol-Myers Squibb after the company had a hard time with its key anti-cancer franchise, Opdivo, which caused it to lose a tremendous amount of market cap. While many investors are betting against the stock with the notion that next quarter will be even weaker, Cramer wouldn't be surprised if Icahn could agitate management enough to prompt a bid for the company. ""Every time you want to give up on a stock, any stock, something good seems to happen,"" Cramer said. Not one of these stocks has been made cheaper by President Trump's agenda, either, and Cramer doesn't expect lawmakers to take action on tax reform until late this year or early next year. ""While the stock market certainly seems expensive, individual companies can often turn out to be quite cheap given better-than-expected earnings, potential take outs or the possibility down the road of a better tax regime,"" Cramer said.

Shares rose 4 percent Monday, at one point trading as high as $280.67, its loftiest level over the past  year. At that price, the stock was less than 4 percent away from its all-time high of $291.42, set in Sept. 14.  Tesla has recently shown progress in its ambitious, even aggressive, plan to bring the Model 3 to market, by saying it was planning to pause its factory in Fremont, California, to retool for Model 3 production. Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch said in a research note Monday that shares ""are trading in line with anticipation of a successful Model 3 launch,"" and they would not be surprised to see Tesla ""opportunistically raise capital to support medium- and long-term growth. We would view a capital raise as a catalyst to the upside given that it would remove part of the near-term bear argument."" Some Tesla bears suspect the company does not have enough capital to complete its Model 3 production ramp on time, or fund the growth of its other projects — such as turning its SolarCity division into a profitable line of products. The company also invited investors and analysts out to Nevada in early January for a tour of its Gigafactory, where it is making Model 3 components along with batteries for both its cars.  A Feb. 9 note from Baird analyst Ben Kallo urged investors to buy the stock ahead of its fourth-quarter earnings release, which is planned for Feb. 22. Kallo cited the Gigafactory tour as a factor in his confidence in the company, and said he thinks Tesla can deliver about 25,000 Model 3 sedans before the end of the year. The stock's current price reflects a nearly 100-point jump from early December, when the stock was trading around $181 per share.","[Tesla, share, hit, Monday, edged, closer, time, company, prepares, announce, earnings, take, step, develop, eagerly, awaited, Model, sedan, Shares, percent, step, develop, eagerly, awaited, Model, sedan, Shares, percent, Monday, point, trading, loftiest, level, past, At, percent, away, time, set, Sept, Tesla, recently, shown, progress, ambitious, aggressive, plan, bring, Model, market, saying, planning, pause, factory, Fremont, California, retool, Model, production, Oppenheimer, California, retool, Model, production, Oppenheimer, analyst, Colin, Rusch, said, research, note, Monday, share, trading, line, anticipation, successful, Model, launch, surprised, Tesla, opportunistically, raise, capital, support, medium, term, growth, We, view, capital, raise, catalyst, upside, given, remove, part, near, term, argument, ...]",1.0

SNA,Snap-On Incorporated,"1:Cramer Remix: This is your chance to buy Amazon, not sell it","Thursday,  2 Feb 2017 |  7:23  PM ET","  President Donald Trump's bold and unpredictable leadership style tends to spark volatility in the stock market, prompting many investors to ask Jim Cramer if it is time to shift retirement investments to cash.    ""My answer is no and yes,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.  Yet that doesn't mean investors should go into cash and dump their stock exposure in their 401(k) and IRA plans, Cramer said. If you are on the verge of needing that money, then he blessed taking some out.     As for a stock investment, a low cost S&amp;P 500 Index fund is something that could be considered for the long-term.    ""You can still pick stocks, but they have to be part of a broader theme, a theme solid enough that it can trump, well, Trump,"" Cramer said. ""Otherwise you will just jettison the stock when the 'Tweeter in Chief' frightens you into selling, at what will no doubt be an inopportune time.""   For investors that believe in the social, mobile, cloud and artificial intelligence cohorts, Cramer recommended Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook. Amazon's stock fell 4 percent after-hours on Thursday because of a lighter than expected forecast. ""These are your chances to get in, not get out and don't be deterred with Facebook just because SNAP filed to go public tonight and its growth looks solid,"" Cramer said.   Facebook has perhaps the best business model of all time, according to Cramer.     ""When you have an amazing product that is beloved and in demand worldwide and it costs very little to produce and has no serious competition. That's Facebook,"" he said.    Thus, Cramer was shocked when investors sold the stock of Facebook on Thursday. He considers the social network to be a very rare company with incredible prospects, with a fairly low stock valuation compared to most other stocks.    ""There aren't many of those and as it goes down over the next couple of days, which has been the pattern, I think you would be nuts to pass it up,"" Cramer said.    Shares of International Paper fell 5 percent on Thursday after the company reported earnings, which CEO Mark Sutton attributed to a ""margins squeeze"" that occurred in the second half of 2016.    ""We had input costs rising. We were able to raise prices, but that's just beginning to take traction as we turn the calendar into 2017,"" Sutton told ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer.    International Paper is the top maker of corrugated packaging in North America, and a major producer of coated paperboard and un-coated free sheet. The stock has had a big run since the election, up to nearly $58 last week from $44 on Election Day.    Snap-on's stock shed 7 percent on Thursday, which seemed very bizarre to Cramer, as he didn't think the numbers reported were disappointing at all. If anything, he thought they looked good.    But this did fall in line with a pattern Cramer detected about the stock. It tends to rally going into the quarter, and then sell off. Eventually investors remember that it is a high-quality stock, and then the stock makes a comeback.    Snap-on is the maker of high-end tools and diagnostic equipment for auto repair shops and various other industries. Cramer spoke with Snap-on's CEO Nick Pinchuk, who explained the strength of the important diagnostics business for the company.    ""If you actually focus on the diagnostic business, which everybody is talking about as the future of car repair, we were up double-digits,"" Pinchuk said.    Unfortunately, the restaurant group has also had a rough couple of months, putting pressure on stocks like Wingstop, down 4 percent this year. When the stock initially came public a year and a half ago, Cramer said it was too hot for his taste and recommended that it would need to come down to gain his interest.    With the Super Bowl around the corner, Cramer spoke with Wingstop's CEO Charlie Morrison, who explained that the company's strong franchise economic model has helped to power growth.    ""We just cleared 1,000 restaurants.

That said, I think they have been consistent enough to give them the benefit of the doubt at 4.21 percent yield. Buy, buy, buy.""

BMY,Bristol-Myers Squibb Company,3:Cramer spells out why you would be a fool to bet against the market now,"Wednesday, 22 Feb 2017 |  6:13  PM ET","Jim Cramer knows a sell-off is inevitable in the market eventually. But right now, he says stocks are rallying because of real reasons that could mean stocks are still undervalued. ""Companies keep beating the earnings estimates and raising their forecasts, rendering the current price-to-earnings multiples pretty much worthless,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. Cramer wasn't rationalizing reasons to buy. The simple fact is that if companies can keep delivering better earnings than expected, then maybe the market is cheaper than investors realize. Both Home Depot and Wal-Mart delivered surprisingly strong quarters this week. The retailers' stocks appeared to be overvalued to Cramer until he heard their earnings calls. Afterwards, their valuations were more reasonable. Both gave analysts ample opportunity to raise estimates. ﻿Watch the full segment here: The same thing happened with Cisco Systems last week and Visa earlier in the month. Based on the previous quarter, Cramer was ready for downbeat numbers from Cisco. Instead, through big contract wins and positive acquisitions, Cisco went from being a potentially expensive stock to being ridiculously cheap after reporting a transformative quarter. Visa's last quarter was a bit weaker than Cramer expected, and he thought there would be a repeat situation. Instead, Visa had acceleration in almost every venue that its business touches in the past few months. Cramer quickly realized that Visa's stock was cheap coming out of the quarter. ""It is not just earnings that is making it hard to bet against this market,"" Cramer said. Activist investor Nelson Peltz's Trian Partners announced a large position in slow-growing Procter &amp; Gamble recently, in a move that would typically lead to higher prices. Cramer found Peltz to be the one activist where if investors bought a position after he announced a new position, they could still consistently beat the market. Likewise, Carl Icahn took a large stake in Bristol-Myers Squibb after the company had a hard time with its key anti-cancer franchise, Opdivo, which caused it to lose a tremendous amount of market cap. While many investors are betting against the stock with the notion that next quarter will be even weaker, Cramer wouldn't be surprised if Icahn could agitate management enough to prompt a bid for the company. ""Every time you want to give up on a stock, any stock, something good seems to happen,"" Cramer said. Not one of these stocks has been made cheaper by President Trump's agenda, either, and Cramer doesn't expect lawmakers to take action on tax reform until late this year or early next year. ""While the stock market certainly seems expensive, individual companies can often turn out to be quite cheap given better-than-expected earnings, potential take outs or the possibility down the road of a better tax regime,"" Cramer said.

QCOM,QUALCOMM Incorporated,2:Why Lionel Richie and other famous investors are betting on this Uber for health care,"Sunday,  5 Mar 2017 |  3:24  PM ET"," In this era of services on-demand, one start-up backed by high-profile investors aims to deliver a doctor to your doorstep in two hours or less: Heal. Today, the two year-old California-based company has announced it plans to roll out its services to select cities in Florida, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas by year-end. Heal is more than just convenient doctor house calls 365 days a year. ""Its larger mission is to transform the broken health care system throughout the value chain,"" said Nick Desai, CEO and co-founder of Heal. ""We do this by freeing doctors from the burden of high administrative costs that force them to see 40 patients a day, by helping patients get convenient care at an affordable price, and by cutting unnecessary medical costs."" The start-up has attracted $55 million in investment from such famous investors as singer Lionel Richie, Qualcomm executive chairman Paul Jacobs and billionaire film producer Thomas Tull of the Tull Investment Group. And it has just added a high-powered tech executive, Rish Tandon, the former general manager of mobile apps at Amazon. The germ of the idea came to founders Dr. Renee Dua and her husband Nick Desai when they had to take their newborn son to the emergency room for a high fever on a Friday night and waited seven hours for a doctor. ""It was then that we had an epiphany and realized families face a real challenge when they have to get themselves or the kids to the doctor, especially during off-hours. So we thought, why not revisit the health care model for patients and their families."" Heal's mobile app is simple. You download it, input your personal information, location and medical symptoms, you pick an appointment time, then input and credit card and insurance information and request a doctor who's guaranteed to be there within an hour. Heal doctors write prescriptions for medication and lab work. And unlike traditional doctors, Heal sends a summary of the services within 24 hours. The price for the house call: a flat fee of $99. The company is connected to Medicare and all major PPOs such as Anthem, Blue Shield, Cigna, Aetna and United Healthcare. Since they are in these insurance networks often the visit is the cost of a co-pay. So far, 75 doctors — internists, pediatricians and primary care physicians — have signed on with the company in major California markets, including San Francsico and Los Angeles. A few have joined Heal full-time, but most work about 20 hours a week on top of other jobs and are paid for their shift. Heal says it has made 16,000 house calls to date — a physician and a medical assistant who manage a portable office take vitals and point-of-site testing for strep, flu and pregnancy, among other conditions. To date, it has driven more than $5.9 million in health care savings, reduced unnecessary prescription antibiotic usage by more than 50 percent, and reduced non-emergency trips to the ER and urgent care by 62 percent for patients and partners. By reducing paperwork and bureaucracy, Desai says the company makes an average revenue of $150 per patient and a gross profit margin of 28 percent in one of its largest and most competitive markets: Los Angeles. According to investor Thomas Tull, ""Heal is on an upward trajectory."" Heal is not the first start-up to offer such a service. Pager, a 3 year-old start-up backed by New Enterprise Associates and Sound Ventures, offers doctors on-demand in New York and San Francisco markets. In addition, companies have cropped up to offer telemedicine services that let patients consult with doctors through their mobile phones such as Doctors on Demand, HealthTap and Teladoc. What is the biggest challenge Heal is facing right now? ""Scaling up and keeping up with fast growth. We have to be selective and hire the most compassionate and skilled caregivers and that vetting is not a simple process,"" said Dr. Dua, chief medical officer and co-founder.","[In, service, demand, start, backed, profile, investor, aim, deliver, doorstep, hour, Heal, Today, old, California, based, company, announced, plan, service, visit, cost, pay, So, far, doctor, internist, pediatrician, primary, care, physician, signed, company, California, market, including, San, Francsico, Los, Angeles, A, joined, Heal, full, time, work, hour, top, job, paid, shift, Heal, say, made, call, date, physician, medical, assistant, manage, start, offer, service, Pager, old, start, backed, New, Enterprise, Associates, Sound, Ventures, offer, doctor, demand, New, York, San, Francisco, market, In, addition, company, cropped, offer, telemedicine, service, let, patient, consult, doctor, mobile, phone, Doctors, Demand, HealthTap, Teladoc, What, biggest, challenge]",1.0

CVI,CVR Energy Inc.,1:Watchdog presses US lawmakers to probe Icahn's role with Trump,"Wednesday,  8 Mar 2017 |  4:40  PM ET","A government watchdog group, Public Citizen, said on Wednesday it has asked lawmakers to investigate whether Carl Icahn violated lobbying disclosure laws, a complaint the billionaire investor denied and called a ""witch hunt."" The group said Icahn may have been acting as a lobbyist when he advised President Donald Trump to overhaul the U.S. biofuels program. Icahn, an unpaid adviser to Trump on regulation, submitted a proposal to Trump last month to change the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard by shifting the burden of blending biofuels into gasoline away from oil refining companies, and further down the supply chain to marketers. Public Citizen said that, because Icahn owns a controlling stake in a refinery that could benefit from the proposed change, he may have been required by a 1995 lobbying disclosure law to disclose his discussions with Trump on the subject as lobbying. The group said it has made its request for a probe in a letter sent to Congress on Wednesday morning. ""All of this has occurred with no record of any (Lobbying Disclosure Act) filings by or on behalf of Mr. Icahn,"" Public Citizen said in a copy of the letter provided to Reuters. Icahn did not respond to Reuters requests for comment but described the complaint in an opinion piece on The Hill website as a ""gross misstatement of the facts"" and said he had vetted his activities with lawyers. 'Ethics rock and a lobbying hard place' The RFS, signed into law by former President George W. Bush, requires oil companies to mix increasing levels of renewable fuels into gasoline and diesel each year - a requirement that many refiners say costs them millions of dollars. Oil companies can either blend biofuels or buy paper credits, known as Renewable Identification Numbers (RIN), from those that have. Icahn owns an 82-percent stake in refiner CVR Energy, which along with other refining companies, has urged the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to shift the blending obligation away from them. ""While we are not fighting the Renewable Fuel Standard, I have for months and will continue to speak out against the misguided way in which the EPA has been administering the RFS"" with regards to the agency's handling of a ""corrupt"" RIN market, Icahn said. Efforts to reach the White House were not immediately successful. ""Carl Icahn is between an ethics rock and a lobbying hard place,"" said Norman Eisen, co-founder of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington who served as the chief ethics lawyer for former President Barack Obama. ""If he claims he is an informal advisor, then he is subject to lobbying rules."" Icahn has disclosed his role as a Trump adviser to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but he has not registered as a lobbyist. Several Democratic lawmakers have said they want more information about his role in the Trump administration. Shares of CVR Energy jumped over 1 percent following Icahn's response but pared gains and was unchanged at $21.40 by 3:47 p.m. EST (2047 GMT). Share values have risen about 70 percent since the presidential election. Over that time, Icahn's stake has gained over $600 million in value, according to Reuters data. Last week, the head of a U.S. biofuels group said Icahn told him that Trump was readying an executive order to change the point of obligation for blending under the biofuels program, something both the White House and Icahn have denied. The White House has said it is reviewing Icahn's proposal and has not yet taken a position.

C,Citigroup Inc.,8:Big US banks to push for easing of money laundering rules,"Thursday, 16 Feb 2017 | 12:30  PM ET"," America's largest banks are to propose a complete overhaul of how financial institutions investigate and report potential criminal activity, arguing that rules imposed in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks and strengthened during the Obama administration are onerous and ineffective, sources said. The Clearing House, a trade association representing the largest U.S. banks including The Clearing House, a trade association representing the largest U.S.banks including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America and Citigroup, haslong raised concerns about the effectiveness of the current rules, butthis will be the first time the group has publicly called for them tobe revamped.   The proposal, which could be published as soon as Thursday, will set the stage for an intensive lobbying effort targeting bank regulators and members of the Senate and House of Representatives finance committees. President Donald Trump has said he wants to cut costly regulations for Wall Street. To keep drug traffickers and terrorists from laundering money through the U.S. financial system, federal law mandates that bank employees file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) with authorities if they suspect transactions could be part of a crime. Faced with record penalties in recent years over failures to alert authorities to criminal activities, banks say they now over-report, filing hundreds of thousands of SARs out of fear of later falling foul of regulators. ""Now we tell banks to file a (report) on everything that might be criminal,"" said Gary Shiffman, CEO of compliance software maker Giant Oak. ""But when everything is a priority nothing ends up being a priority."" The number of suspicious activity reports rose from 669,000 in 2013 to almost a million in 2016, according to U.S. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FINCEN), which enforces anti-money laundering rules and collects data on suspicious transactions from banks around the country.  Complying with anti-money laundering rules, including the manpower needed to file suspicious activity reports, costs U.S. companies as much as $8 billion a year, the Heritage Foundation estimated in a report last year. The Clearing House will propose a new system under which banks do not investigate and report every transaction that could possibly raise a red flag, according to people involved in the effort. Instead, banks would focus on investigating and reporting transactions based on specific concerns relayed to them by law enforcement. Under this approach, banks could shift their focus, as law enforcement priorities change. Institutions in different parts of the country may also watch out for certain types of criminal transactions, based on information from authorities. For example, law enforcement could warn banks in the southwest of the United States to look out for drug traffickers moving funds to Mexico, according to people involved in drafting the proposal. The Clearing House will also call for the creation of an information-sharing platform that would allow banks to share data among themselves about possible criminal transactions. For international banks, the group will push for the U.S. Treasury's FinCEN to be responsible for investigating compliance, rather than the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a main bank regulator. Since FinCEN is already responsible for sharing threat data with law enforcement agencies, the agency will be better able to determine if banks are making a substantial contribution to law enforcement efforts, the bank group will argue. 'New set of eyes' It remains to be seen what kind of reception such a proposal will get from U.S. law enforcement officials and regulators, who have spent years learning how to turn SARs into leads for fruitful investigations. A FinCEN spokesman pointed out dozens of criminal cases made with the help of SARs listed on the agency's website. The spokesman said the agency is unable to collect comprehensive statistics on how often SARs lead to successful prosecutions. Even if controls were loosened at the federal level, state regulators such as the New York Department of Financial Services may not let banks alter course. Just last month, the New York regulator imposed a new anti-terrorism regulation requiring banks to beef up suspicious activity reporting. The New York regulator declined to comment for this story. Representatives of Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup also declined to comment. Critics say banks have only themselves to blame for greater scrutiny of the sector. In 2012, HSBC agreed to pay $1.9 billion in U.S. fines for failing to prevent money laundering violations by Mexican drug traffickers. In 2014, JPMorgan agreed to pay $2.6 billion over allegations it failed to tell authorities about its suspicions of fraud at Bernie Madoff's fund. The bank lobby waited for Trump to take office in the hope that a new administration will see the money laundering regulations through ""a new set of eyes,"" said one person involved in writing the proposal. Watchdog groups balk at the idea that the regulations could be loosened in any way. ""I have concerns with the banks even doing what they are supposed to do now,"" said Heather Lowe, director of government affairs at Global Financial Integrity, an organization that pushes for stricter anti-money laundering enforcement.

FB,"Facebook, Inc.",41:Why strategist Tom Lee is turning bullish on these four hot stocks,"Tuesday, 21 Feb 2017 |  7:53  AM ET","After advising investors to fade the so-called FANG stocks in 2016, well-known strategist Tom Lee now says that the group of tech stocks could be one of the best bets this year. ""This year we're flipping, and we actually think FANG is going to outperform the market [by] as much as 31 percent,"" Lee, founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, said Friday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" Though it might seem counterintuitive to see these high-flying tech stocks — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet — as overvalued, Lee furnishes a surprising stat to make just that argument. The four companies ""accounted for nearly 20 percent in the revenue growth over the last five years in the S&amp;P, but they've only captured 13 percent of the market cap growth, meaning there's still a catch-up on the market cap to how much they've contributed to the revenues,"" Lee pointed out. In addition, the tech stocks could be great picks for inflationary times. With their reliance on highly skilled employees and wellsprings of intellectual property, the four names have high market value per worker. That means that if wages rise, these companies could see their expenses rise less than those in more labor-intensive industries. To be sure, Lee's call may not feel particularly contrarian insofar as all four of the stocks are outperforming the S&amp;P 500 this year. Indeed, the acronym was coined by Jim Cramer to refer specifically to large tech high-fliers. But the group did underperform the market in 2016, amid broader optimism about the economy as a whole. And Lee argues that it makes sense to view FANG as a sector unto itself, noting that if it was one of the S&amp;P 500's sectors, it would be the eighth largest, ranking higher than REITs, utilities, materials and telecom. When asked to name a favorite FANG stock, Lee chose Amazon, which he called ""a really differentiated business model."" His least favorite is Netflix, which he said could fall prey to regulatory changes around net neutrality.","[think, FANG, going, outperform, market, percent, Lee, founder, Fundstrat, Global, Advisors, said, Friday, CNBC, Trading, Nation, Though, counterintuitive, flying, tech, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google, Alphabet, overvalued, Lee, furnishes, surprising, stat, make, argument, The, company, accounted, nearly, percent, revenue, growth, year, percent, revenue, growth, year, S, amp, P, captured, percent, market, cap, growth, meaning, catch, market, cap, contributed, revenue, Lee, pointed, In, addition, tech, great, pick, inflationary, time, With, reliance, highly, skilled, employee, wellspring, intellectual, property, name, market, value, worker, That]",0.0

WYNN,"Wynn Resorts, Limited",1:Top S&P 500 CEOs weigh in on Trump's effect on business and the economy,"Saturday, 11 Feb 2017 |  5:12  PM ET"," Donald Trump has set the corporate world abuzz. Some companies fear his tweets. Others gleefully anticipate his proposed tax cuts. All of them, it seems, are anxiously waiting to see how the Trump Era affects their bottom lines. To find out about executives' fears and hopes, CNBC reviewed every instance where S&amp;P 500 executives mentioned Trump by name in this quarter's corporate earnings calls — the teleconferences where execs field questions from analysts or reporters. Here are nine especially revealing quotes: ""Several of us in our business were sitting within 30 feet of President Trump when he took his oath of office on the platform last Friday. We all believe, and I mean all of us, that the most overwhelmingly important event geopolitically for the next 50 years is liaison, a constructive liaison between the People's Republic of China and the United States of America. That truth is undeniable. That dynamic is unquestioned."" ""Basically, President Trump recognizes that the F-35 is a very large program, it's the largest program in the Department of Defense. He wants to make sure... that the American taxpayer is getting the lowest possible cost on the program. And we understand his concerns about affordability, we certainly share that ... And it's not about slashing our profit, it's not about our margins when we have those discussions, it's about how do we get the cost of the aircraft down today and in the future. ""Well, first of all, we've obviously been following the Trump administration closely in terms of what you're talking about on tax reform. And it looks like we're going to ... lower the top rate to somewhere around 20 percent, eliminate the deductibility of interest but also provide for immediate expensing of capital. Also provide for a territorial system which is really good news for us because, as you know, we've got about $6 billion in cash sitting overseas that we can bring back to the U.S. very cost-effectively."" ""President Trump's clearly very focused on enacting policies that will grow the U.S. economy and grow American jobs, and we're very supportive of that. So I'm encouraged by his engagement. His approach to engaging business, having an open dialogue, discussing the issues, finding solutions, finding ways to grow U.S. manufacturing jobs I think are all very positive. And that engagement is a productive approach. We welcome it. We've got a voice at the table."" ""President Trump's focus of enhancing the ability for manufacturing industries to thrive and produce jobs, well, that's AEP's service territory. His focus on a balanced portfolio of energy resources, including fossil fuels, that's also AEP's service territory. So as I said before the election, whether focused on the Clean Power Plan as in Hillary Clinton's proposals or President Trump's proposals, AEP should prosper..."" ""First, in an overall sense, I've been very pleased with the agenda that the Trump administration has. We have seen an avalanche of regulation over the last decade, and putting a much more balanced cost/benefit framework in place to assess the value of those regulations, freeing up infrastructure pipelines, all of that is quite positive for our business, for the country, job creation, and a lot of things. So that is very much a positive."" We are ""very encouraged by their discussion about a strong infrastructure bill. Both President Trump and (Democratic) Senator (Sherrod) Brown are speaking about something significant in the neighborhood of about $1 trillion dollars over the next 10 years. That has a significant impact on steel consumption."" I also think what's interesting for 2017 is ... some of the European elections that we're going to see in 2017. As you know, we get a tremendous amount of revenue coming out of Europe. And that is something that, with the elections coming up, I believe in Germany and France this year both, it could be another volatile situation. I'm not saying it's going to be the same as when President Trump was elected, but that's something that we could look at. So I think geopolitical volatility could be definitely in the mix...""

""During periods of reflation, pricing power becomes increasingly important as companies that have the ability to raise price are far better positioned to deal with rising input costs vs. those who are more 'price takers' within their respective industries."" To find the best technology stocks with pricing power, Goldman searched for companies with dominant market share, higher average selling prices (ASP) for its products relative to its industry peers and wide gross profit margins.",[],0.0
GS,"Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (The)",34:Stocks post record close for fifth-straight day as Trump continues to tout economic agenda,"Wednesday, 15 Feb 2017 |  4:00  PM ET","U.S. stocks closed at fresh highs Wednesday for a fifth-straight day as traders continued to bet on a pro-growth agenda under President Donald Trump.  ""The market reacts positively when we think we're getting close to"" a policy announcement, said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. ""As long as we stay focused on that, the market is going to continue to go higher."" The president continued to tout his economic agenda in a meeting with retail CEOs Wednesday. The Dow Jones industrial average added 107 points with Procter &amp; Gamble contributing the most to gains. Shares rose 3.7 percent after CNBC reported late Tuesday, citing sources, that Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management has taken a stake in Procter &amp; Gamble and the funds' current position is worth roughly $3.5 billion.   Official filings released Tuesday also showed several major U.S. hedge fund investors moved significant parts of their portfolios into financial and pharmaceutical stocks. Health care climbed nearly 1.2 percent Wednesday to lead the S&amp;P 500 higher in the close.  The financials sector closed up 0.7 percent as the third-best performer remains the top gainer in the S&amp;P 500 since election with gains of more than 22 percent. The SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) hit at an all-time high. ""We're halfway through the first quarter and ... people have to chase performance,"" said Peter Coleman, head trader at Convergex. ""At the end of the day, the sentiment is you're going to get some tax reform and some infrastructure policy,"" he said. On Wednesday, Trump said the administration remains ""focused on the issues that will bring economic growth. That's what we're all about.""  The SPDR S&amp;P Retail ETF (XRT) closed up 0.9 percent with the largest market-cap stock, Amazon.com, closing three-quarters of a percent higher. Groupon led advancers, surging 23 percent after reporting a strong quarter.  However, shares of H&amp;R Block tumbled more than 2 percent to hit a session low after Trump said the company probably wouldn't like his tax reform plan. Shares recovered to close 0.8 percent lower. Stocks had closed at record highs again on Tuesday, lifted by the financials sector, which received a lift from higher interest rates. The major U.S. stock indexes had traded mostly sideways this year, until Trump said last week the administration will be releasing a ""phenomenal"" tax plan in the next two-to-three weeks. ""I think what may have started off as short covering, then a short squeeze, has brought in some money off the sidelines into the more cyclical areas of the market,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth.  The initial pop in equities following Trump's election was mostly spurred by hopes of infrastructure spending, deregulation and lower corporate taxes. But the transition into Trump's presidency has been bumpy. On Monday, Trump's National Security Advisor Michael Flynn resigned from his post after days of speculation about his status within the administration and intense scrutiny into his discussions about Russia prior to Trump's inauguration. ""The market has been surprisingly generous to Trump,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. ""If we learn that Trump did something unethical ahead of the election, then that would have some impact. But barring something of that magnitude, I think the market will continue to shrug off those issues."" In economic news Wednesday, the consumer price index (CPI) rose a more-than-expected 0.6 percent in January, the largest monthly gain since February 2013. In the 12 months through January, the CPI increased 2.5 percent, the biggest year-on-year gain since March 2012. After the inflation report, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan economists increased their expectations for a rate hike as soon as March or May.  U.S. Treasury yields spiked following data releases, with the benchmark 10-year note yield breaking above 2.5 percent, while the shorter-term two-year note yield climbed to 1.26 percent. The U.S. dollar traded lower against a basket of currencies, with the euro near $1.06 and the yen around 114.1 yen against the greenback. Retail sales also beat expectations, with the headline number showing a 0.4 percent rise for January after an upwardly revised 1 percent gain in December. The so-called core retail sales, excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, posted a 0.4 percent rise. ""This market, for a long time, was hungry for a growth story,"" said Jim Davis, regional investment manager for The Private Client Group of U.S. Bank. ""Every time we get a number supporting that, more people jump on the bandwagon."" Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen testified in front of Congress for the second straight day. She acknowledged the economy is weak, but Fed policies have helped and the economy is close to achieving the Fed's goals on employment and inflation. On Tuesday, Yellen lifted market expectations for a March rate hike after saying it would be ""unwise"" for the Fed to wait too long.  ""Our view is the over/under on rate hikes for this year is at two. But the data continue to come in stronger,"" said Michael Collins, senior investment officer at PGIM Fixed Income. ""I think it gives the Fed more room to act how they've communicated."" ""But there are still a lot of risks in the global economy, and in the U.S. there is some policy risk,"" he said. Other data released include business inventories for December, which rose 0.4 percent, and the February read on U.S. home builder sentiment, which showed a decline. ""You can see that the picture is changing as inflation has picked up over in China and this is having a more prominent impact over in the U.S.,"" said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, in a note. ""The U.S. retail sales data was hot and it tells us how much investors are willing to dig deep into their pockets and how confident they are in their spending attitude."" The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 107.45 points, or 0.52 percent, at 20,611.86, with Procter &amp; Gamble the top advancer and Merck the greatest laggard. The S&amp;P 500 closed up 11.67 points, or 0.5 percent, at 2,349.25, with health care leading seven sectors higher and utilities the greatest laggard. The Nasdaq composite gained 36.87 points, or 0.64 percent, at 5,819.44.  Advancers were a step ahead of decliners on the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 844 million and a composite volume of about 3.8 billion in the close. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, rose to trade near 12, its highest since Feb. 2. Gold futures for April delivery settled up $7.70 at $1,233.10 an ounce.  U.S. crude oil futures for March delivery settled down 9 cents at $53.11 a barrel.  —CNBC's Everett Rosenfeld and Reuters contributed to this report.

Honeywell did reaffirm its prior 2017 earnings outlook.    General Dynamics — The defense contractor beat estimates by 10 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of $2.62 per share, though revenue fell below forecasts. The company calls the quarter ""solid"" and notes an increase in profit margins.    Comcast — The NBCUniversal parent was downgraded to ""sector weight"" from ""overweight"" at Pacific Crest, saying the current valuation fails to reflect increased competitive risk.    American Airlines — The airline matched estimates, earning an adjusted 92 cents per share, while revenue beat estimates. The company also approved a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization.    Ford — The automaker's stock was upgraded to ""outperform"" from ""sector form"" at RBC Capital following Thursday's earnings report and subsequent stock price drop. RBC said expectations surrounding Ford are low and that the next earnings revision is likely to be higher.    Colgate-Palmolive — The consumer products maker reported adjusted quarterly profit of 75 cents per share, in line with estimates, but revenue fell below forecasts. Colgate's overall pricing came in higher, but total sales were lower compared to a year earlier.    Intel — The chipmaker beat estimates by 5 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of 79 cents per share. Revenue also beat forecasts as the PC market stabilized and demand increased for Intel's data center services.    Starbucks — Starbucks matched estimates with adjusted quarterly profit of 52 cents per share, but the coffee chain's revenue came in below forecasts, as did the 3 percent increase in both global and U.S. comparable store sales.    Alphabet — Alphabet reported adjusted quarterly profit of $9.36 per share for its latest quarter, missing estimates of $9.64, though the Google parent's revenue did beat forecasts. Profit did increase by 8.3 percent over a year earlier, with more mobile usage, but analysts have noted that advertisers are not willing to pay as much for mobile searches as they are for their desktop equivalents.    Microsoft — Microsoft came in 4 cents above estimates with adjusted quarterly profit of 83 cents per share, with the software giant's revenue also beating Street forecasts. Microsoft is seeing growing demand for its newer cloud services, as it continues to shift emphasis away from the traditional software business.    PayPal — PayPal earned an adjusted 42 cents per share for its latest quarter, with both the top and bottom lines matching Street forecasts. The payment service company's total payment volume did miss estimates, however.    TransCanada — TransCanada submitted its permit application to the State Department for the now-revived Keystone XL pipeline project.    Juniper Networks — Juniper earned an adjusted 63 cents per share for its latest quarter, 3 cents above estimates, while the networking services company's revenue also beat forecasts. However, Juniper's shares came under pressure after the company predicted lower than expected current quarter results.    VMWare — VMWare beat estimates by 4 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.43 per share, while revenue beat forecasts as well. The cloud services company also announced a $1.2 billion stock repurchase plan.    Wynn Resorts — Wynn missed estimates by 35 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of 50 cents per share, although the casino operator did see revenue come in above forecasts. Investors, however, are encouraged by upbeat results at the company's Wynn Palace resort in Macau.

GOOGL,Alphabet Inc.,16:Traders discuss Alphabet's stock after YouTube TV announcement,"Tuesday, 28 Feb 2017 |  7:12  PM ET"," After YouTube announced a live and on-demand television subscription, called ""YouTube TV,"" the ""Fast Money""traders said Google parent and YouTube owner Alphabet is the stock to trade.  The new video service will cost $35 for a family plan of six accounts with up to 40 sports and entertainment networks and access to original content from YouTube Red.  Trader Dan Nathan said he likes Google's accelerated revenue growth because it will know how to monetize the service better than companies like Netflix who have seen growth in the streaming arena. Nathan said Alphabet could also buy Twitter in order to push out more of their content and bring audiences to their platform.   Trader Tim Seymour said he likes Alphabet because of the growing ad industry. Seymour said YouTube's 1 billion viewing hours per day and better tools for advertisers will make the subscription service more attractive to reach broad audiences.  The $35 price tag for YouTubeTV stops trader Steve Grasso from jumping on the stock. He likes Amazon and Netflix in the space. Grasso said the price is too high for consumers who want a combination of video streaming services or subscribe to the YouTube service in addition to cable.

WB,Weibo Corporation,2:Super Bowl goes social as NFL seeks China touchdown,"Sunday,  5 Feb 2017 |  6:31  PM ET","As millions around the world settle into couches and tune into the Super Bowl on big-screen TVs on Sunday, fans in China will be watching the American football championship on mobile phones and tablets - on their way to work. The National Football League is looking to score with audiences in China, where the game starts during morning rush hour, via a push on social media. For the first time, the Super Bowl will stream live on popular messaging platform Sina Weibo. The stakes are high for the league's bid to tap the enormous potential of China's 1.4 billion people. U.S. sports leagues and media companies are increasingly looking to China's market for growth. World Wrestling Entertainment, for example, is training Chinese athletes in hopes of turning them into television sensations. For this year's Super Bowl between the New England Patriots and Atlanta Falcons, one of the biggest hurdles is the Sunday afternoon kickoff, which will come at 7:30 on Monday morning in China, 14 hours ahead of game time at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas. China's interest in football provides another challenge. The sport is still new to the country, and the NFL is pushing tie-ups with more than a dozen platforms on regular television and online to help reach viewers, even at rush hour, Richard Young, managing director for NFL China, told Reuters in recent interviews. ""They watch (the games), they pause them. They get on and off the bus and on and off the taxi,"" Young said. The NFL wants to build enthusiasm in China and other overseas markets after a season in which U.S. television viewership dropped 8 percent, according to Nielsen data, to a weekly average audience of 16.5 million. About 1.5 million people in China now watch live NFL matchups each week on digital platforms, Young said. Many are young people aged 20 to 30 who catch games on mobile phones as they commute, he said. Some Chinese fans follow the league by watching only highlights rather than entire games. The NFL provides near-live recaps with a series of short clips that show big plays soon after they occur on the field. The fan base in China has grown 1,000 percent over the past five years, Young said. Boot camps The Super Bowl broadcast in China will feature Chinese graphics and announcers explaining the rules and plays. The NFL has hosted ""boot camps"" for Chinese commentators to bone up on touchdowns, fumbles and other football jargon. Hong Kong superstar singer and actor William Chan, the NFL's China ambassador, will attend the game in Houston, where he is expected to post updates for his more than 21 million followers on Weibo. And later this year, the league plans to expand a fantasy football league it is testing called Tian Tian NFL, Young said. Still, the NFL lags far behind sports such as basketball in China. Industry experts said many of today's football fans in China are Americans living abroad or foreign-born Chinese. ""There is no existing fan base but for the expats and people who were educated and lived in the United States,"" said Marc Ganis, the president of consulting firm Sports Corp Ltd and an adviser to NFL teams, who has worked in China for more than a decade. ""That's an enormous challenge."" The social media drive will fit well with the sport in China, said Ed Desser, a former NBA television executive who helped popularize American basketball in China. ""You can converse with your friends or people who were complete strangers who happen to be watching the same game,"" said Desser, now president of consulting firm Desser Sports Media. ""It's the virtual bar stool.""

TWTR,"Twitter, Inc.",18:Donald Trump's Twitter engagement is stronger than ever,"Thursday, 16 Feb 2017 |  9:46  AM ET","Many Americans may be losing patience with President Donald Trump's Twitter account, but that hasn't kept his tweets from getting millions of favorites and retweets since his inauguration.  Americans from both parties have told pollsters that Trump should shut down his personal Twitter feed, but engagement with the account has skyrocketed since the Jan. 20 inauguration. In the month since the ceremony, favorites have been about twice what they were after the election, when Trump's tweets criticizing companies and selecting Cabinet members made national news. Thirty-three of the top 50 most-favorited Trump tweets were from this year, and retweets showed a similar pattern.  President Barack Obama activated the first presidential Twitter account in May 2015, gaining hundreds of thousands of followers for the @POTUS account in a matter of minutes. The Trump administration inherited that account in January, along with its 14 million followers. Obama handed over his named social media accounts, including @BarackObama, his account during the campaign, to an independent nonprofit group in January 2013. But Trump opted to keep his personal account — and its millions of followers — as a primary communication channel.  ""I'd rather just let that build up and just keep it @realDonaldTrump,"" Trump told the Times of London in January. ""It's working.""  Although some reports indicated that Trump would not use the @POTUS account, he has been making use of both accounts, signing some @POTUS tweets ""-DJT."" So far, it appears that the @POTUS account is putting out staid administrative tweets, while the @realDonald Trump contains more of the off-the-cuff attacks that won the campaign so much attention during the election.    Before the election, Trump's account had about 13 million followers. By Jan. 20, the account had hit 21 million, and today it has about 25 million. Favorites and retweets have increased even more than the number of followers, according to data pulled by CNBC from the Twitter API.  Trump's use of Twitter can have real consequences for companies like Boeing, General Motors, and Ford, which have found themselves in the president's crosshairs on the social media platform. According to a recent analysis, Trump's negative tweets targeting companies encouraged other users to attack those companies as well. But at least one company is enthusiastic about the president's relentless tweeting: Twitter itself. While he noted that a single person can't drive sustained growth, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said on the company's earnings call last week Trump has helped the platform at the ""macro level."" ""The President's use of Twitter has broadened the awareness of how the platform can be used, and it shows the power of Twitter,"" said Dorsey. ""When he tweets, it sparks conversation and discussion."" Dorsey bought $7 million worth of shares in the company this week, according to regulatory forms filed on Tuesday.  Despite the popularity of Trump's personal Twitter account, it's still about 60 million followers behind @BarackObama. The former president tweeted that he was retaking control of his old handle on Jan. 20, a tweet that received 1.9 million favorites and almost 450,000 retweets. None of Trump's recent tweets has come close to those figures.

DuPont also said it expected its merger with Dow Chemical to close during the first half of the year.   Verizon — Verizon fell 3 cents a share shy of estimates, with adjusted fourth-quarter profit of 86 cents per share. Revenue beat Street forecasts. Verizon saw year-over-year revenue fall 5.6 percent as it added far fewer wireless subscribers than analysts had expected.

Travelers did see underwriting results fall in its auto insurance sector, but that was more than made up for by improvements in other lines.   Johnson &amp; Johnson — J&amp;J reported earnings of $1.58 per share for the fourth quarter, 2 cents a share above estimates. Revenue came in slightly below forecasts. The medical device maker also gave a full-year forecast that falls below analysts' estimates.

The largest U.S. home builder saw profit rise more than 31 percent over a year earlier as it sold more homes.   3M — 3M reported quarterly profit of $1.88 per share, 1 cent a share above estimates.

Amazon.com — Amazon sold 3.1 million Echo speakers in the U.S. during the fourth quarter, according to Dow Jones, citing estimates from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Amazon does not release Echo figures on its own, but the research firm said about 8.2 million have been sold in the U.S. since the Echo's 2014 debut, owing a large part to a big jump in consumer awareness of the product.   Rio Tinto — The mining company sold its Australian coal unit to Yancoal Australia for up to $2.45 billion in cash. Yancoal is an entity controlled by the Chinese government.   Avis Budget — Avis put a ""poison pill"" in place aimed at keeping its largest shareholder, hedge fund SRS Investment Management, from gaining more control over the car rental company.

Shares of both fell about 1 percent on the day the report came out.    Exxon was downgraded to market perform from outperform at Wells Fargo, citing a closed window for an acquisition. McDonald's was downgraded on slowing sales, while Disney was lowered by Pivotal from hold to sell to account for changes in earnings expectations and changing political risks.     And Citi downgraded Goldman to sell from neutral in a valuation call after the recent runup for the financials group.

It will be plowed back in to hiring more people, if they can find them,"" Cramer said. Cramer told CNBC's ""Power Lunch"" that in the time that he has known Hayes, this was the most bullish he has ever seen Hayes on every single division of the company. Hayes said his biggest problem right now is that he can't find enough workers to install elevators for the Otis Elevator division. Hayes affirmed the positive relationship with the current administration, and said United Technologies is right on the cost curve committed for the F135 engines it makes to power the F-35 aircraft. In 2016, the Joint Program Office awarded Pratt &amp; Whitney a $1.5 billion low rate initial production contract for the F135 systems. ""We're right on the cost curve that we've committed to the government,"" Hayes said. ""That is about an 89 percent learning curve. So, every time we double production, we're coming down in cost by about 11 percent and that's exactly what we committed to when we started the program, and we're right on that line.""

JPM,JPM,10:Big US banks to push for easing of money laundering rules,"Thursday, 16 Feb 2017 | 12:30  PM ET"," America's largest banks are to propose a complete overhaul of how financial institutions investigate and report potential criminal activity, arguing that rules imposed in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks and strengthened during the Obama administration are onerous and ineffective, sources said. The Clearing House, a trade association representing the largest U.S. banks including The Clearing House, a trade association representing the largest U.S.banks including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America and Citigroup, haslong raised concerns about the effectiveness of the current rules, butthis will be the first time the group has publicly called for them tobe revamped.   The proposal, which could be published as soon as Thursday, will set the stage for an intensive lobbying effort targeting bank regulators and members of the Senate and House of Representatives finance committees. President Donald Trump has said he wants to cut costly regulations for Wall Street. To keep drug traffickers and terrorists from laundering money through the U.S. financial system, federal law mandates that bank employees file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) with authorities if they suspect transactions could be part of a crime. Faced with record penalties in recent years over failures to alert authorities to criminal activities, banks say they now over-report, filing hundreds of thousands of SARs out of fear of later falling foul of regulators. ""Now we tell banks to file a (report) on everything that might be criminal,"" said Gary Shiffman, CEO of compliance software maker Giant Oak. ""But when everything is a priority nothing ends up being a priority."" The number of suspicious activity reports rose from 669,000 in 2013 to almost a million in 2016, according to U.S. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FINCEN), which enforces anti-money laundering rules and collects data on suspicious transactions from banks around the country.  Complying with anti-money laundering rules, including the manpower needed to file suspicious activity reports, costs U.S. companies as much as $8 billion a year, the Heritage Foundation estimated in a report last year. The Clearing House will propose a new system under which banks do not investigate and report every transaction that could possibly raise a red flag, according to people involved in the effort. Instead, banks would focus on investigating and reporting transactions based on specific concerns relayed to them by law enforcement. Under this approach, banks could shift their focus, as law enforcement priorities change. Institutions in different parts of the country may also watch out for certain types of criminal transactions, based on information from authorities. For example, law enforcement could warn banks in the southwest of the United States to look out for drug traffickers moving funds to Mexico, according to people involved in drafting the proposal. The Clearing House will also call for the creation of an information-sharing platform that would allow banks to share data among themselves about possible criminal transactions. For international banks, the group will push for the U.S. Treasury's FinCEN to be responsible for investigating compliance, rather than the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a main bank regulator. Since FinCEN is already responsible for sharing threat data with law enforcement agencies, the agency will be better able to determine if banks are making a substantial contribution to law enforcement efforts, the bank group will argue. 'New set of eyes' It remains to be seen what kind of reception such a proposal will get from U.S. law enforcement officials and regulators, who have spent years learning how to turn SARs into leads for fruitful investigations. A FinCEN spokesman pointed out dozens of criminal cases made with the help of SARs listed on the agency's website. The spokesman said the agency is unable to collect comprehensive statistics on how often SARs lead to successful prosecutions. Even if controls were loosened at the federal level, state regulators such as the New York Department of Financial Services may not let banks alter course. Just last month, the New York regulator imposed a new anti-terrorism regulation requiring banks to beef up suspicious activity reporting. The New York regulator declined to comment for this story. Representatives of Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup also declined to comment. Critics say banks have only themselves to blame for greater scrutiny of the sector. In 2012, HSBC agreed to pay $1.9 billion in U.S. fines for failing to prevent money laundering violations by Mexican drug traffickers. In 2014, JPMorgan agreed to pay $2.6 billion over allegations it failed to tell authorities about its suspicions of fraud at Bernie Madoff's fund. The bank lobby waited for Trump to take office in the hope that a new administration will see the money laundering regulations through ""a new set of eyes,"" said one person involved in writing the proposal. Watchdog groups balk at the idea that the regulations could be loosened in any way. ""I have concerns with the banks even doing what they are supposed to do now,"" said Heather Lowe, director of government affairs at Global Financial Integrity, an organization that pushes for stricter anti-money laundering enforcement.

HD,"Home Depot, Inc. (The)",2:More homeowners cashing in on their new housing wealth,"Friday,  3 Mar 2017 | 10:55  AM ET","Homeowners are opening their favorite piggy bank again — their homes. As home values rise faster than expected, that increased homeowner wealth suddenly seems more enticing. It's showing up in big remodeling growth and higher profits for retailers like Home Depot and Lowe's, but it also serves as a warning sign. Ever since the epic housing crash at the end of the last decade, homeowners have been extremely conservative with their home equity. Even those who had money in their homes kept it there, fearing another downturn in prices. Now, as millions of borrowers come up from underwater on their home loans and many more see their home values jump sizably on paper, borrowing more is back in favor. Home equity lines of credit, known as HELOCs and often serving as second loans, allow homeowners to pull cash out of their homes when they need it. HELOC volume is now up 21 percent in the past two years, to the highest level since 2008, according to Moody's. It is still nowhere near its housing boom level, when many people treated their homes like ATMs, but the trajectory is definitely pointing higher. ""The more second liens that people take out, it adds a risk that comes from the rising home prices. The fact that people are leveraging their homes more than before makes things more risky,"" said Peter McNally, senior analyst at Moody's. Borrowers are also putting smaller down payments on home loans now, starting with less home equity either to save cash or because they can't afford anything more. To put it in perspective, before the last housing boom, the median down payment was just over 7 percent. It then dropped to 3 percent during the height of the boom, as lenders offered all kinds of ""creative"" loan products that required little to no down payment. After the crash, much of that lending became illegal and new rules made low down-payment loans more expensive to produce. As a result, down payments rose back above 7 percent again during the recovery. At the end of 2016, the median down payment had fallen to 6 percent, according to ATTOM Data Solutions, and it appears to be headed lower, as lenders offer more low down-payment products. One wrench in the run to grab equity is the fact that interest rates are rising. That makes loans more expensive and consequently takes the shine off low down-payment loans, which require added mortgage insurance. The fourth quarter of 2016 brought the first significantly higher mortgage rates in more than three years. ""Rising interest rates did seem to have a chilling effect on homebuyers using financing, as evidenced not only by the drop in purchase loan originations but also a corresponding rise in the share of cash buyers, drop in FHA buyer share and a rise in the average down-payment percentage in the fourth quarter compared to the previous quarter,"" said Daren Blomquist, vice president at ATTOM. Homeowners are clearly leaning toward more leverage, but they are doing so in a far different environment than in 2006. Mortgage underwriting is far stricter, especially for home equity loans, and borrowers must prove their ability to repay loans, including all financial documentation. Home equity continues to rise steadily, according to the Federal Reserve Board, and it is still rising faster than borrowers are withdrawing it. The caution comes amid a growing concern that home prices are overheating. Tight supply, rather than income growth, is pushing prices, and that is not a sustainable scenario. While it is unlikely that home prices will fall nationally, the gains will inevitably shrink, and some of the hottest markets could see sizable retreats, putting pressure once again on the amount of housing wealth. Correction: This story was revised to correct that McNally is with Moody's and that the study on home equity lines of credit was by that firm.","[As, home, value, rise, faster, expected, increased, homeowner, wealth, suddenly, enticing, It, showing, big, remodeling, growth, higher, profit, retailer, like, Home, Depot, Lowe, serf, warning, sign, Ever, epic, housing, crash, end, decade, homeowner, extremely, conservative, home, equity, Even, home, kept, home, value, rise, faster, expected, increased, homeowner, wealth, suddenly, enticing, It, showing, big, remodeling, growth, higher, profit, retailer, like, Home, Depot, Lowe, serf, warning, sign, Ever, epic, housing, crash, end, decade, homeowner, extremely, conservative, home, equity, Even, home, kept, fearing, Even, home, kept, fearing, downturn, price, Now, million, borrower, come, underwater, home, loan, home, value, jump, sizably, paper, borrowing, favor, ...]",1.0

SIG,Signet Jewelers Limited,"2:After oil's plunge, traders watching whether Draghi will rock the boat","Wednesday,  8 Mar 2017 |  6:30  PM ET","Stock trading Thursday will likely hinge on oil prices and headlines from Europe, as traders await Friday's key report on jobs. After Wednesday's blow-out private payrolls figures and a plunge in oil prices, U.S. stocks closed mixed. The Nasdaq composite eked out a gain of 3.6 points, while the Dow lost 69 points and the S&amp;P 500 fell 5.4 points to close at 2,362.98 as energy stocks dragged. The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE) fell 2.5 percent Wednesday to below its 200-day moving average. That's ""not healthy,"" Scott Redler, chief strategic officer at T3 Trading, said in an email. ""If it stays below the 200-day for multiple sessions it shows true weakness."" In a steep intraday drop, U.S. crude oil futures plunged 5.4 percent to their lowest close since Dec. 7 after weekly inventory data showed a bigger-than-expected build. The slide took oil prices past a technical support level of $51.22 a barrel to a settle of $50.28, and now all eyes are on the psychologically key $50 level.  ""We won't have a newer input"" on crude oil data Thursday, said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. ""But what's startling about this is technically we've broken support."" ""You've got a lot of movement in the energy [stocks]. They have a lot to give back,"" he said. The breakdown in oil prices, a Federal Reserve intent on raising rates, potential government policy announcements, Friday's jobs report and coming elections in Europe put Thursday's session in the middle of major market events.  Against those uncertainties, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi will try to ""not rock the boat"" when he speaks Thursday, said Athanasios Vamvakidis, head of G10 FX strategy in Europe for Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  The ECB is due to release its decision on monetary policy Thursday at 7:45 a.m., ET, followed by a press conference at 8:30 a.m. Traders will watch for any signals from Draghi on when the central bank may further trim its asset purchase program, or taper. ""The Q&amp;A might be more interesting given headline inflation is now at 2 percent and euro zone data is very strong,""  Vamvakidis said. He did note that core inflation in the euro zone is still below 1 percent, which could give Draghi reason to maintain current accommodation in monetary policy. The central bank is scheduled to cut its monthly purchases from 80 billion euros to 60 billion euros in April, and keep that pace until at least December.  ""I think at least the currency markets are going to be watching this meeting very closely,"" said  Chris Konstantinos, director of international portfolio management at RiverFront Investment. ""A definitive change in tone from Draghi would be very unexpected.""  Traders said Fed and the dollar will likely be the bigger drivers in the euro-dollar, however. The U.S. dollar index hit its highest in nearly a week on Wednesday, while the euro was last near $1.054. ""The Federal Reserve is a swing central bank right now,"" said Karl Schamotta, director of FX research and strategy at Cambridge Global Payments. ""It is the one that is prone to change. [The] key question is whether we have alternate interest rate hikes scheduled throughout the year."" The Fed seems set to raise interest rates at its meeting next week, barring any negative surprise from Friday's employment report. Goldman Sachs and UBS Wealth Management raised their forecasts on the headline nonfarm payrolls figure well above 200,000 on Wednesday after the ADP Employment report surprised with a 298,000 print. The U.S. two-year Treasury yield hit a fresh seven-year high after the ADP report and was last trading slightly below that level, near 1.35 percent. The 10-year yield and 30-year yield hit their highest since December.  The Treasury is scheduled Thursday to auction $12 billion in 30-year Treasury bonds. Economic reports due for release Thursday include the Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas job cut report, weekly jobless claims, the Fed balance sheet and import and export prices. Natural gas inventories are also scheduled for release. Signet Jewelers, Staples and Party City are scheduled to report earnings ahead of the open Thursday. Ulta Beauty, El Pollo Loco, Finisar and Verifone are set to post results after the close. Thursday also marks the eighth anniversary of the bull market. As of Tuesday's close, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 250 percent since March 9, 2009, including cumulative dividends. ""For me the thing is this bull market is a bit of a mystery in that it's the second longest bull market in history,"" said Mike Arone, chief investment strategist for the U.S. intermediary business.  Given that the last time stocks fell more than 5 percent was last June, real interest rates remain low, and credit spreads remain tight, he said, ""the bull market could continue for a little while longer.""

AET,Aetna Inc.,13:Investors need insurers to answer three critical questions this earnings season,"Sunday, 29 Jan 2017 | 12:59  PM ET","  For three of the nation's largest health insurers, the big question this earnings season is: now what?   Nearly two years after pursuing megamergers to compete in the era of Obamacare, Aetna and Humana's $34 billion deal has been blocked by the court, and a ruling on Anthem's $54 billion dealt acquire Cigna is pending.    But now Congress and the White House are poised to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, and the timeline and details of how they'll do it are very much up in the air. As the companies report their earnings, analysts will be looking for insight into how the insurers plan to deal with uncertainty.  ""Sales for the health insurers have grown rapidly because of the ACA,"" driven in part by the expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare, said Jeff Loo, a health care equity analyst with CFRA Research.   While many of the health insurers faced losses on Obamacare exchange plans, overall, over the last five years, the group experienced the biggest earnings growth within the S&amp;P 500 Managed Health Care index, with a compounded annual growth rate of 23.1 percent over the last five years, according to CFRA Research.  ""We expect increased volatility as Trump and the Republicans reveal their replacement plans for the ACA.,"" Loo said.    Aetna and Humana said they are exploring next steps, after a federal judge blocked their merger last week. Judge John Bates of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that the deal would lessen competition in the Medicare Advantage and individual Obamacare markets, rejecting the companies' claim that the savings from merger synergies would result in better prices for consumers.  For analysts, a big question is whether Aetna will be able to keep Humana from looking for a higher price from a new bidder.  ""We see low probability of a successful appeal given the decisiveness of the opinion,"" wrote Evercore ISI analyst Michael Newshel in a note to clients, adding that Humana now becomes a more attractive acquisition target for other insurers with less overlap in the Medicare market.  Aetna will have to pay Humana a $1.85 billion break-up fee, under the terms of the deal if the merger is not approved by Feb. 15, which could pose a risk to the Hartford-based insurer's full year earnings outlook.   When Aetna reports Tuesday, the company is expected to report earnings of  $1.44 per share for the fourth quarter on $15.84 billion in revenue, according to the Thomson Reuters estimates. For the full year 2017, the company is expected to report earnings per share of $8.79 on revenue of $62.8 billion.     U.S. District Judge Amy Jackson Berman is expected to issue a decision on Anthem and Cigna's merger before month's end. Analysts and industry experts also expect that deal to be blocked, but in this case the two firms are seen parting ways.     Analysts have speculated that Anthem and/or Cigna could make a bid for Humana once the pair's deal is terminated.  Cigna CEO David Cordani told investors he would be ready to make an acquisition if the judge rejected the company's proposed deal with Anthem, during a session at the JP Morgan Health Care Conference earlier this month. ""If we're in a situation where our deal is not allowed to go forward, we will have in excess of $5 billion of deployable cash,"" Cordani said. He added that they could raise up to $9 billion more ""to the extent that we wanted to use our capacity for more M &amp; A.""  Anthem faces paying Cigna a $1.85 billion break-up fee under the terms of the agreement, which would represent roughly 5 percent of its projected revenue of $86.7 billion for 2017, according to Thomson Reuters analyst estimates.   Anthem reports on Wednesday, and is expected to earn $1.61 per share for the quarter on $20.92 billion in revenue. Cigna reports results the day after, and is expected to earn $1.74 per share in its latest quarter, on $9.9 billion in revenue.    Beyond merger developments, analysts will be looking for all three insurers to talk about their views on the policy negotiations over repealing Obamacare in Washington, but it's not clear that insurers have any better insights than observers at this point.  President Donald Trump met with manufacturing CEOs and the chiefs of the big three U.S. automakers during his first week to talk about keeping jobs in America. One big question for the insurers is whether they expect to get an invitation to the White House anytime soon to meet with the president about replacing Obamacare.

EPD,Enterprise Products Partners L.P.,"2:Cramer's game plan: What I expect for Apple, Amazon and Facebook earnings","Friday, 27 Jan 2017 |  6:25  PM ET","  Regardless of what President Donald Trump does next, Jim Cramer says earnings are still running the show on Wall Street.    ""The best chances to make money come when the initial negativity brings stocks down and then upon closer inspection people realize that those stocks shouldn't be down at all. Look for those situations,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.    Next week's earnings are filled with companies that investors are all watching. With this in mind, Cramer outlined his take on the stocks and events scheduled for next week:    Monday: Enterprise Products PartnersCramer calls this one of the best pipeline companies on Earth. He's looking to hear what Trump's deregulation agenda could mean for the future.    Tuesday: Exxon Mobil, AppleExxon Mobil: The feedback from this company will control the direction of oil on Tuesday. Cramer doesn't expect any surprises, but based on Chevron's earnings he will be mindful that Exxon could have a big impact.    Apple: In the wake of its recent run to $120, Cramer expects traders to sell it both before and after the quarterly report. Bears will be in full force, saying that Apple's best days are behind it. For those investors who don't own the stock, Cramer said to wait because there could be a better chance to buy.    With Apple's gigantic cash hoard overseas, it could be a major winner if Trump introduces a repatriation deal. Cramer will be looking to hear about its service revenues and the iPhone 8.    ""I'm a realist; the stock has had a monster move. Be ready for some profit-taking,"" Cramer said.    Wednesday: FacebookWith Facebook's stock also on a run recently, Cramer is nervous because Alphabet also reported a strong quarter, but got hit anyways. He expects Facebook to say it needs to spend a lot of money on video, which could hurt the stock.    ""Think bigger on both Facebook and Alphabet because these companies are doing everything they can to dominate the world, so you can't worry about a given quarter's spending as long as it has a clear path for a payoff,"" Cramer said.    Thursday: Amazon, ChipotleAmazon: This is also a period of spending for Amazon, as it must build its infrastructure around the globe to replicate its domination in the U.S. Cramer isn't worried about the bottom line. He will be watching the top line, which is what matters. He says it could be spectacular, just like Netflix.    The world is going online, Cramer said, and there could be a chance to buy the stock if its earnings-per-share number is disappointing.    Chipotle: Cramer doesn't expect a turn in the stock until the company is 18 months past its last illness incident, which took place in Dec. 2015. He warned not to jump the gun, but says the stock has bottomed.    Friday: Non-farm payrollCramer is willing to bet this will be a strong number because so many companies have reported that business has gotten better. He's hoping for a strong number so the Federal Reserve can raise interest rates and drive the banks higher.    Questions for Cramer?

CBG,"CBRE Group, Inc.",1:Cramer: Tax reform and repatriation are not what stocks need to roar higher,"Monday, 27 Feb 2017 |  6:40  PM ET","Virtually everyone on Wall Street assumes that President Trump's agenda for taxes and foreign assets must be passed in order for the stock market to roar higher this year, but Jim Cramer disagrees. ""The idea that we MUST have corporate tax reform and repatriation is something I no longer feel is as imperative as it once was,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. There was certainly no denying that Trump's championing of these issues and his endless parade of meetings with executives has helped the investing climate in the U.S. But that doesn't mean the stock market should throw away the necessity of growth and earnings as a dominant force. ""As long as we get worldwide growth like we are beginning to have, than in my view, we don't really need these two initiatives to propel this market,"" Cramer said. In fact, the longer it takes Trump to pass these initiatives, the more investors can buy stocks with the notion that they will be there eventually. Apparel maker PVH Corp, which has brands such as Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, has managed to make the numbers in retail while the competition has failed. Cramer attributed this to the strength of PVH's brands in Europe and Asia. Approximately 24 percent of PVH's $8 billion revenue stems from Europe, which is now subsidizing the 54 percent that is in the U.S. Likewise, global commercial real estate services company CBRE Group has 56 percent of its revenue coming from Europe and Asia Pacific. Those regions are now driving the growth of the company. ""While our corporate taxes are significant for many businesses, the truth is that international growth is much more important and we are finally getting it,"" Cramer said. Trump's initiatives for deregulation and repatriation certainly help create a positive investing climate, but Cramer isn't banking on it to drive the market. Instead, he would much rather have revenue growth, and for the first time in a long time, the international markets are finally producing it. Questions for Cramer?

KO,Coca-Cola Company (The),"12:In Airbnb’s Super Bowl Ad, Implied Criticism of Trump’s Travel Ban","Sunday,  5 Feb 2017 |  9:37  PM ET"," Ever since President Trump moved to sharply limit immigration, Silicon Valley executives have tweeted, blogged and voiced their opposition. Airbnb, one of the most aggressive corporate critics of Mr. Trump's policy, took its opposition to the Super Bowl. More from the New York Times:Super Bowl Commercials: Immigration and Diversity Show Up in Some Ads   Trump and Staff Rethink Tactics After Stumbles   'S.N.L.' Goes After Trump Again, With Melissa McCarthy as Sean Spicer  Airbnb created a Super Bowl advertisement showing a diverse group of people and text that read: ""We believe no matter who you are, where you're from, who you love or who you worship, we all belong. The world is more beautiful the more you accept."" The Airbnb ad came just nine days after Mr. Trump signed an executive order to temporarily close America's borders to all refugees and to citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries. The ad referred to the ban only obliquely so as not to run afoul of guidelines that say commercial time is not ""for viewpoint or advocacy of controversial issues."" The National Football League and Fox, the broadcaster of the game, maintain the right to approve ads, and some advertisers walked a tightrope to get ads with immigrants approved. Before the game started, Coca-Cola re-aired an ad from 2014 called ""America the Beautiful,"" which depicts Americans of different races and religions singing the song in a variety of languages. The building supply company 84 Lumber had to change an ad that showed a Spanish-speaking mother and daughter in front of a border wall. In a memo to employees after the executive order, Airbnb's chief executive, Brian Chesky, was more explicit about his opposition. ""This is a policy I profoundly disagree with, and it is a direct obstacle to our mission at Airbnb,"" Mr. Chesky wrote on Jan. 29. That weekend, the company began to provide free and subsidized temporary housing for people who had been affected by the immigration restrictions. Two Airbnb officials who were not permitted to speak on the record said the company had not planned to advertise during the Super Bowl until executives heard there was still ad space left. Mr. Chesky and the company's two other founders, Joe Gebbia and Nathan Blecharczyk, worked with Jonathan Mildenhall, the company's head of marketing, to put together the 30-second spot in three days, an effort that typically takes weeks or even months. A cut of the ad was shown to a small group of employees on Thursday, and it was finished the next day and sent to the N.F.L. It aired right before the second quarter. Airbnb was using the Super Bowl to highlight its commitment to provide short-term housing for 100,000 people in need over the next five years, including for refugees, victims of natural disasters and aid workers. The company has also committed to donate $4 million over the next four years to the International Rescue Committee, a group that helps displaced people around the world. ""Airbnb has been supporting refugees well before the current controversies,"" said David Miliband, the organization's president and chief executive. In 2015, Airbnb provided travel credits to relief workers at Mercy Corps and the International Rescue Committee and gave matching donations to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. In 2016, the company was a partner in the White House's Call to Action to respond to the global refugee crisis. ""Airbnb's mission to bring strangers together who help each other in various ways is core to our mission as well,"" Mr. Miliband said. ""So many Americans were refugees.

ZG,"Zillow Group, Inc.",1:Homes sell fastest during these two weeks,"Thursday,  2 Mar 2017 |  8:00  AM ET","No question, this spring is a seller's market. Low supply and high demand for housing are making it that way. Homes are already selling two weeks faster than they did a year ago, according to the National Association of Realtors, but sellers looking to unload their homes in the shortest period of time need to time it just right. Homes listed between May 1 and May 15 sell nine days faster than an average listing, according to a new survey by Zillow, a real estate listing company. Not only do they sell faster during these two weeks, they sell for a $1,500 premium. Why these two weeks? Again, it's today's very tight market. ""With 3 percent fewer homes on the market than last year, 2017 is shaping up to be another competitive buying season,"" said Zillow chief economist Svenja Gudell. ""Many homebuyers who started looking for homes in the early spring will still be searching for their dream home months later. By May, some buyers may be anxious to get settled into a new home — and will be more willing to pay a premium to close the deal."" In other words, desperate times translate into higher offers. Of course, as with everything real estate, certain markets have different ""best time to sell"" dates. Washington and Atlanta homes move fastest in the first two weeks of April. Boston, Phoenix and Los Angeles homes are hottest during the second two weeks of April. For sellers in Detroit, Pittsburgh and much of Florida, getting the house listed early, in March, will result in the fastest sale. ""In colder climates like Boston, Chicago and Seattle, buyer interest tends to spike a bit later in the summer; in warmer areas like Miami, Tampa and Phoenix, the best time to list comes earlier in the spring,"" said Gudell. ""Typically, sellers in climates without distinct seasons will find themselves with more flexibility in list time frame, as these markets show little variation in sale price based on listing month."" Of course, some agents think the heavy competition in spring might make other seasons a better bet for sellers. ""Higher spring inventory brings out many more buyers and creates a lot of buzz and activity,"" said Ben Hirsh, an Atlanta area real estate agent. ""However, the higher inventory during those same months can mean there is a lot more competition from other sellers competing for buyers' attention."" Researchers at Zillow also said homes listed on Saturdays garner the most views, but at real estate brokerage Redfin, Thursday is the going theory for getting the most eyeballs. Redfin says more people preparing for weekend open houses start looking on Thursday and are already out shopping by Saturday.","[Realtors, looking, unload, home, shortest, period, time, need, time, right, Homes, listed, May, May, day, faster, average, listing, according, survey, Zillow, estate, listing, company, Not, faster, premium, Why, Again, today, tight, market, With, percent, fewer, home, market, shaping, competitive, buying, estate, listing, company, Not, faster, premium, Why, Again, today, tight, market, With, percent, fewer, home, market, shaping, competitive, buying, said, Zillow, chief, economist, Svenja, Gudell, Many, homebuyers, started, looking, home, searching, dream, home, month, later, By, May, buyer, anxious, get, Many, homebuyers, started, looking, home, searching, dream, home, month, later, By, May, buyer, anxious, get, settled, home, willing, pay, premium, ...]",1.0

GOOGL,Alphabet Inc.,13:The ‘Netflix for fitness’ company raging with millennials — with zero competition,"Friday,  3 Mar 2017 |  6:56  PM ET","Private company Peloton hit the fitness industry by storm in 2012 with its unique niche as a purveyor of stationary at-home bikes. It streams 12 hours of live cycling classes a day, and connects riders with more than 4,000 on-demand classes. Just five years later, the company now has over 200,000 riders around the world, and zero competition. However, co-founder and CEO John Foley told ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer that he expects the competition to come rolling in. The term ""peloton"" refers to a group of cyclists that ride closely together to save energy. ""Right now there is no competition. Peloton is the only game in town. But because it is so good, because it is so coveted, because the consumers love it, we expect competition to come from all angles,"" Foley said. Foley started as an engineer for Mars in 1990 and later held positions as the CEO of Evite.com, co-founder and CEO of Pronto.com and President of BarnesandNoble.com. He said he was inspired to create Peloton after he and his wife became addicted to instructor led group fitness classes. However, with kids and a busy career, time to go to those classes became limited.  Watch the full interview here: Instead, he and his team built a technology enabled platform that allowed users to consume the content on their own schedule and location. The key to its business model is that Peloton does not make a lot of money on the bikes that it sells. Instead, the company makes its money from the $39 a month subscription fee. ""We are not going to be a stationary bike company. We are going to be a disruptive company,"" Foley said. Cramer is always pointing to the stay-at-home economy as a theme built to last. This refers to the shift seen in the market, where stocks that cater to people at home are the ones that succeed, such as Netflix and Amazon. He attributed its success to tapping both the stay-at-home economy with the trend of healthy living. And while some may fear competition stemming from a SoulCycle or Flywheel, Foley said it is technology that distinguishes it away from these popular cycling studios. ""We are a very, very hardcore technology company. We make a tablet computer better than Apple … We are as hardcore of a tech shop as anything in New York City right now, so if SoulCycle or Flywheel were to try and reinvent themselves as somebody who can compete with software engineers at Google, than maybe they can come after us,"" Foley said.

GNC,"GNC Holdings, Inc.",1:Cramer Remix: The stock that lives and dies with the border tax,"Friday, 24 Feb 2017 |  7:16  PM ET","Warren Buffett taught Jim Cramer, and many other investors, that the stock market is made up of stocks and not completely tied to politics or the averages. That's why when the market pulled back from its remarkable run on Friday, Cramer wasn't calling for a top. Instead, he will be watching the moves that individual companies make next week. ""If individual companies report good numbers, they can buck the top calling trend provided the economy remains as strong as we have seen since the year began,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. With this in mind, he outlined the stocks and events he will be watching next week. One stock on his radar recently is Constellation Brands, which has been impacted by the possibility of President Trump's proposed border tax. However, Cramer clarified that it has a unique edge because the Mexican beers it imports, like Corona and Modelo, can't be made in the U.S. A Mexican beer made in Flint, Michigan isn't a Mexican beer.  While the retail cohort has been struggling recently, Jim Cramer slammed the vitamin retailers as being worse off than the rest of the group. Two of the largest publicly-traded players in the space are GNC Holdings and Vitamin Shoppe, which both initially roared higher after coming public, but have fallen dramatically in the past two years. ""We've got two very ugly train wrecks here,"" Cramer said. Initially, these two stocks were loved, as more people became obsessed with losing weight, doing cleanses and taking supplements. Vitamin Shoppe went public in 2009 and GNC in 2011 and for the first few years the stocks were solid growth stories. But by the time 2015 came along, the companies started to struggle as nothing they did seemed to work and business slowed. Shares of live entertainment company Live Nation fell 3 percent on Friday, but Cramer thinks this was merely because the stock has run up so much and investors were profit-taking after the gains. Live Nation owns 167 venues in seven countries, along with four of the five largest music festivals in North America. It also has an artist management business and owns Ticketmaster. After the company delivered a small top and bottom line beat with solid guidance, Cramer spoke with CEO Michael Rapino so said he is very proud of the results. ""We had a spectacular record year, and the best news is it looks sitting here in February like we are on to 2017 on another continual strong year,"" Rapino said. Back in December, Cramer introduced investors to CBRE Group as a way to play real estate without actually owning a real estate investment trust. REITs tend to become less attractive when the Fed raises interest rates because their high yield suddenly becomes competition to higher yielding bonds. CBRE is the world's leading purveyor of commercial real estate services. Not only does it own property, but it also helps real estate investors by providing outsourced leasing, sales, appraisal, development and property management services. Since Cramer's recommendation, CBRE has rallied more than 20 percent. The company has also made three acquisitions. Cramer spoke with CBRE's CEO Bob Sulentic, who said he expects President Trump's agenda to be healthy for the economy moving forward. ""The talk about tax rates getting better is helpful, the talk about infrastructure spending is helpful, lower regulation could be really good for a lot of our clients particularly financial institutions so we're hopeful that good things will happen,"" Sulentic said. Cramer envies the rich hedge fund managers that have the audacity to call a top in the market. They never need to be right because the worst case scenario is that they are early. ""Top calling, like loving, means never having to say you're sorry,"" he said. Somehow the top-caller's position or performance never are discussed when they are calling a top. After all, that would be rude for Cramer to say: ""I see this is your fifth top call during a period when the Dow Jones Average has gone from 18,000 to 20,000 … and I have read your investment letters for years and you have repeatedly said the market is dangerous and you were underexposed to the market each time, so are you still underexposed, or short?"" But that is exactly what Cramer thinks is the right thing to do. In the Lightning Round, Cramer gave his take on a few stocks from callers: Palo Alto Networks: ""After speaking with Chuck Robbins last week from Cisco, I started to get a little bit more nervous about Palo Alto Networks and the aggressive way that Chuck is coming on in cybersecurity. So let's just say, not as strong as I felt one time ago before I spoke with Chuck."" Tanger Factory Outlet: ""Almost 4 percent yield and I think that is still an experiential opportunity when you go to those. By the way, in good times and in bad times, bingo.""","[Mexican, While, retail, cohort, struggling, recently, Jim, Cramer, slammed, vitamin, retailer, worse, rest, group, Two, largest, publicly, traded, player, space, GNC, Holdings, Vitamin, Shoppe, initially, roared, higher, coming, public, fallen, dramatically, past, year, We, got, ugly, train, wreck, Cramer, said, While, retail, cohort, struggling, recently, Jim, Cramer, slammed, vitamin, retailer, worse, rest, group, Two, largest, publicly, traded, player, space, GNC, Holdings, Vitamin, Shoppe, initially, roared, higher, coming, public, fallen, dramatically, past, year, We, got, ugly, train, wreck, Cramer, said, Initially, We, got, ugly, train, wreck, Cramer, said, Initially, loved, people, obsessed, losing, weight, clean, taking, supplement, Vitamin, Shoppe, went, public, ...]",1.0

F,Ford Motor Company,16:US CEOs to meet with Trump amid tension over his policies,"Friday,  3 Feb 2017 |  6:27  AM ET","President Donald Trump will huddle with chief executives of major U.S. companies on Friday as the business community finds itself increasingly split over how to respond to his policies. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick on Thursday quit the business leaders' group, a panel selected by Trump in December, under pressure from activists over Trump's week-old executive order halting travel to the United States for people from seven Muslim-majority countries. Executives from Ford Motor and Tesla also criticized Trump's travel ban, but other advisory group members, including General Motors and JPMorgan Chase have not taken a position. Trump previously met with executives from the U.S. pharmaceutical and auto industries as part of a push to step up U.S. job creation. U.S. companies of all political stripes want Trump, a Republican, to fulfill a campaign pledge to slash corporate taxes, but a schism has developed over how to do it. The splits highlight business leaders' struggles to navigate a divisive political environment and a new president who does not hesitate to use his platform against companies that vex him. The businessman-turned-politician has threatened companies that manufacture in Mexico with a 20 percent tax on imports and needled pharmaceutical executives to make more drugs in the United States. On Thursday, he publicly cheered South Korea's Samsung Electronics for saying it might build a U.S. plant for its home appliances business.  Some investors want companies to speak up.  ""I certainly don't think investors want people who run corporate America to be afraid of making smart business decisions,"" Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities, said in an interview on Thursday. The sharpest outcry about Trump's travel restrictions, which caused chaos and protests at U.S. airports last weekend, came from tech companies, which have broad concerns about his immigration plans. Uber criticized the ban but took heat from activists when its chief competitor, Lyft, appeared more vocal on the issue. ""Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president,"" Kalanick said in a memo explaining why he left Trump's advisory panel. Tesla's Elon Musk said in a tweet on Thursday: ""In tomorrow's meeting, I and others will express our objections to the recent executive order on immigration and offer suggestions for changes to the policy.""  The White House said in a statement on Thursday evening that did not mention Uber that Trump ""understands the importance of an open dialogue with fellow business leaders to discuss how to best make our nation's economy stronger."" Split on tax reform A more complicated division is developing over taxes. Boeing and General Electric on Thursday joined a group in support of a congressional plan to tax all imports. But that plan, which does not have universal support among Republicans, is opposed by many U.S. retailers, which say it could raise prices for consumers. Republican leaders say tax reform is a top priority, but they have acknowledged it could take until the end of 2017 or longer to finish legislation. ""If I were a company, I'd be worried about tax reform,"" said  Bernie Williams, chief investment officer at USAA Investment Solutions, in San Antonio. The White House meeting with the group, which also includes leaders of the Cleveland Clinic, PepsiCo and IBM, is set to cover tax and trade, regulatory relief and infrastructure.","[group, panel, selected, Trump, December, pressure, activist, Trump, old, executive, order, halting, travel, United, States, people, Muslim, majority, country, Executives, Ford, Motor, Tesla, criticized, Trump, travel, ban, advisory, group, member, including, General, Motors, JPMorgan, Chase, taken, position, Trump, previously, met, panel, selected, Trump, December, pressure, activist, Trump, old, executive, order, halting, travel, United, States, people, Muslim, majority, country, Executives, Ford, Motor, Tesla, criticized, Trump, travel, ban, advisory, group, member, including, General, Motors, JPMorgan, Chase, taken, position, Trump, previously, met, executive]",1.0

So, when Snap went public and didn't get screwed up, he was shocked. ""The inability of the stock exchanges and the bankers themselves to handle high-profile hot merchandise has created a sense of fragility about the whole asset class and turned a lot of people off to stocks just when they were beginning to gather a full head of steam with the public,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. Snap made its debut in a 200 million share public offering priced at $17 a share on Thursday, and began trading at a $7 premium, at $24 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. While some investors may regard the stock as being hopelessly overvalued, Cramer recognized that it could have played havoc on the entire market if something had gone wrong. ﻿Watch the full segment here: It could have turned out like the Facebook deal, which prompted concern for the entire underwriting process. It could have been like Twitter, which was too hot too soon. Snap could have been designed to offer a big pop like what happened with Zynga and Groupon, as only a small amount of stock was released initially and there was real angst about how the stock market can store wealth. ""When one of these blows up, it makes you feel reckless trying to save money with these flimsy pieces of paper,"" Cramer said. Based on the action for Snap, Cramer valued the stock at 35 times sales, almost twice what Facebook sold for when it came public. But Facebook was on the verge of profitability and Snap isn't anywhere near it. While he couldn't condone paying that much for a stock, he pointed to the syndication process on Wall Street for the heavy valuation. Still, it was a significant occasion that the deal managed to go off without a hitch Thursday. Here are four things that Cramer said could have gone wrong but didn't: No. 1: It turned out that there was a lot of money around to buy shares of Snap. Sometimes with a big deal, investors will sell similar stocks to buy the stock that hit the tape. There was selling, but it took place in other groups outside of tech. No. 2: Despite the expensive price of the stock, there wasn't any panic because it was handled in a smooth and practiced way . No. 3: After Wednesday's rally, the market could have easily had a dramatic decline, but instead had more of a ""garden variety"" decline from the Dow's 21,000 level. No. 4 Shares of Caterpillar were crushed when news broke that its headquarters were raided by federal authorities who were executing on a search and seizure warrant for documents and electronic information. This stock is a big component of the Dow and has a huge following, so the industrials could have been hammered. Instead, they barely moved. ""A declining day following a rampaging bull run is a sign of health, especially when it is associated with a gigantic, yet well run IPO. It should ultimately bring out more buyers than sellers, and more initial public offerings of companies that had been fearful to tap the markets,"" Cramer said. Questions for Cramer?

Last year 50 private companies, with a combined net worth of $241 billion, made our CNBC Disruptor 50 list by reimagining an array of industries — from aerospace to pharmaceuticals to finance. These included household names like Uber, Airbnb, Spotify and Snapchat (now Snap). It featured the return of 23andMe, a genetic testing company, emerging from years of regulatory battles to regain a spot on the list after a few years away. It featured high-flying newcomers like Jaunt and Instacart. And Twilio made the list for the fourth and final time as it went on to have one of the most successful IPOs of 2016.    Many on the 2016 CNBC Disruptor list have also been on a fundraising tear, raising billions of dollars that in turn have pumped up their companies' valuations to the stratosphere.

GE,General Electric Company,16:Tax reform is at the top of the wish list for the biggest US stocks,"Friday, 20 Jan 2017 |  3:00  PM ET","  Of S&amp;P 500 companies reporting earnings so far, tax reform is the most talked about policy change, according to FactSet analysis published Friday.     Forty-two firms have posted quarterly results as of Wednesday, and FactSet said 11 discussed tax policy in their conference calls. Six of those 11 said lower taxes would would benefit their customers, clients or themselves, the analysis said.     Goldman Sachs was among them:    ""... to the extent to which tax rates come down, we're a beneficiary. But obviously, changes in tax policy can be a huge catalyst for how all of our clients think about deploying their capital, strategic decisions.""   Delta Air Lines, FedEx, Comerica, Cintas and Paychex also spoke positively of tax reform, the report said.  President Donald Trump has proposed cutting the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent. While the final figure is likely to be somewhere in between, analysts expect reductions in the tax rate to boost companies' revenues, and consequently their earnings.  Note: Companies that cited or discussed a potential border tax were counted under ""Trade Policy"" and not ""Tax Policy."" Numbers do not total 27 because some companies discussed multiple policy topics.    Not all the discussion around tax reform has been positive, however. Retailers and oil refiners have spoken against a proposed ""border adjustment"" tax plan that would increase their costs, since those industries bring product from overseas to sell into the United States. The border adjustment idea would tax imports but leave exports untaxed.   General Electric, which was not included in the FactSet study, said in its conference call Friday that ""border adjustability"" would not affect what the company pays in taxes overseas.     GE also said that most of the tax policy discussion so far ""is all speculation"" and ""what GE wants, and what we think is most important (for) competitiveness for U.S. companies, is essentially a competitive tax rate.""   U.S. stocks have rallied to record highs since the November election, with most analysts attributing the gains to bets on Trump's promised tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation. Others say the economic environment is favorable for companies to grow, regardless of what may be a disappointing political regime.    ""The policy part of it may take longer to figure out than markets anticipate,"" said Paul Christopher, head global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. ""If they start talking about tax reform next week, I think that will be a very positive thing.""    ""Really the major policy initiatives that will matter for earnings will develop over time and probably won't be implemented until 2018,"" Christopher said, noting that a better economy overall should support earnings growth regardless of government policy.     S&amp;P 500 earnings per share are expected to post a second straight quarter of growth, after four quarters of earnings decline, according to CFRA Research.

Fields said the automaker has the right amount of assembly plants around the country, as Trump pushes corporate America to build more of their products in the United States.    ""I think we have the appropriate amount of assembly plants here in the U.S. Of course, we're always looking to growth our business and use our assets here even more,"" the Ford CEO said.    Earlier this year, after being called out by Trump, Ford said it was canceling construction for a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico, and planning instead to invest $700 million at its Flat Rock, Michigan, plant and add 700 direct new jobs at that facility to produce high-tech electrified and autonomous vehicles, plus the Ford Mustang and Lincoln Continental.    Trump asked the chief executives of Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler at Tuesday's White House meeting how his administration can help ""generate an environment for more growth here in the U.S.,"" Fields said.    ""We volunteered to continue to work with his administration on policies that will support both investment and job creation here in the U.S.,"" he added. ""We have to see how the policies develop and solidify over time.""

DVN,Devon Energy Corporation,1:The Pruitt Emails: E.P.A. Chief Was Arm in Arm With Industry,"Wednesday, 22 Feb 2017 | 12:30  PM ET","During his tenure as attorney general of Oklahoma, Scott Pruitt, now the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, closely coordinated with major oil and gas producers, electric utilities and political groups with ties to the libertarian billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch to roll back environmental regulations, according to over 6,000 pages of emails made public on Wednesday. The publication of the correspondence comes just days after Mr. Pruitt was sworn in to run the E.P.A., which is charged with reining in pollution and regulating public health. ""Thank you to your respective bosses and all they are doing to push back against President Obama's EPA and its axis with liberal environmental groups to increase energy costs for Oklahomans and American families across the states,"" said one email sent to Mr. Pruitt and an Oklahoma congressman in August 2013 by Matt Ball, an executive at Americans for Prosperity. That nonprofit group is funded in part by the Kochs, the Kansas business executives who spent much of the last decade combating federal regulations, particularly in the energy sector. ""You both work for true champions of freedom and liberty!"" the note said. Mr. Pruitt has been among the most contentious of President Trump's cabinet nominees. Environmental groups, Democrats in Congress and even current E.P.A. employees have protested his ties to energy companies, his efforts to block and weaken major environmental rules, and his skepticism of the central mission of the federal agency he now leads. Read more from The New York Times: Senate confirms Scott Pruitt as E.P.A. head E.P.A. workers try to block Pruitt in show of defiance  Fight erupts in Trump administration over transgender students' rights An Oklahoma judge ordered the release of the emails in response to a lawsuit by the Center for Media and Democracy, a liberal watchdog group. Many of the emails are copies of documents previously provided in 2014 to The New York Times, which examined Mr. Pruitt's interaction with energy industry players that his office also helps regulate. The companies provided him draft letters to send to federal regulators in an attempt to block federal regulations intended to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from oil and gas wells, ozone air pollution, and chemicals used in fracking, the email correspondence shows. They held secret meetings to discuss more comprehensive ways to combat the Obama administration's environmental agenda, and the companies and organizations they funded repeatedly praised Mr. Pruitt and his staff for the assistance he provided in their campaign. The correspondence points to the tension emerging as Mr. Pruitt is now charged with regulating many of the same companies with which he coordinated closely in his previous position. As attorney general of Oklahoma, Mr. Pruitt took part in 14 lawsuits against major E.P.A. environmental rules, often in coordination with energy companies such as Devon Energy, an Oklahoma oil and gas producer, and American Electric Power, an Ohio-based electric utility. The emails show that his office corresponded with those companies in efforts to weaken federal environmental regulations — the same rules he will now oversee. ""Please find attached a short white paper with some talking points that you might find useful to cut and paste when encouraging States to file comments on the SSM rule,"" wrote Roderick Hastie, a lawyer at Hunton &amp; Williams, a law firm that represents major utilities, including Southern Company, urging Mr. Pruitt's office to file comments on a proposed E.P.A. rule related to so-called Startup, Shutdown and Malfunction Emissions. The most frequent correspondence was with Devon Energy, which has aggressively challenged rules proposed by the E.P.A. and the Department of Interior's Bureau of Land Management, which controls drilling on federal lands — widespread in the west. In the 2014 election cycle, Devon was one of the top contributors to the Republican Attorneys General Association, which Mr. Pruitt led for two years during that period. In a March 2013 letter to Mr. Pruitt's office, William Whitsitt, then an executive vice president of Devon, referred to a letter his company had drafted for Mr. Pruitt to deliver, on Oklahoma state stationery, to Obama administration officials. Mr. Pruitt, meeting with White House officials, made the case that the rule, which would rein in planet-warming methane emissions, would be harmful to his state's economy. His argument was taken directly from Mr. Whitsitt's draft language. ""To follow up on my conversations with Attorney General Pruitt and you, I believe that a meeting — or perhaps more efficient, a conference call — with OIRA (the OMB Office of Information and Regulatory Analysis) on the BLM rule should be requested right away,"" Mr. Whitsitt wrote. ""The attached draft letter (or something like it that Scott is comfortable talking from and sending to the acting director to whom the letter is addressed) could be the basis for the meeting or call."" The letter referred to the section of the White House Office of Management and Budget that coordinates regulations throughout the government. Senate Democrats last week unsuccessfully urged their colleagues to delay a vote on Mr. Pruitt's confirmation until the emails were released. The emails do not appear to include any request for his intervention explicitly in exchange for campaign contributions, although Mr. Pruitt was separately working as a member of the Republican Attorneys General Association to raise money from many of the same companies. Despite the large volume of correspondence between Mr. Pruitt's office and the industry players, the emails are unlikely to cause Mr. Pruitt significant new problems. They do expand on email exchanges or topics that previously had been disclosed. The Oklahoma attorney general's office has withheld some documents, asking the judge to determine if they can be exempted from the order requiring their release. There are also other pending open-records requests, from the Center for Media and Democracy, The Times and other news organizations.","[David, H, Koch, environmental, regulation, according, page, email, made, public, Wednesday, The, publication, correspondence, come, day, Mr, Pruitt, sworn, run, E, P, A, charged, reining, pollution, regulating, public, health, Thank, respective, boss, push, President, Obama, EPA, axis, liberal, environmental, group, energy, sector, You, work, champion, freedom, note, said, Mr, Pruitt, contentious, President, Trump, cabinet, nominee, Environmental, group, Democrats, Congress, current, E, P, A, employee, protested, tie, energy, company, effort, weaken, environmental, rule, skepticism, central, mission, federal, agency, lead, Read, The, company, effort, weaken, environmental, rule, skepticism, central, mission, federal, agency, lead, Read, The, New, York, Times, Senate, confirms, Scott, Pruitt, ...]",1.0

Caterpillar —  The heavy equipment maker reported adjusted quarterly profit of 83 cents per share, beating estimates of 66 cents, but revenue was below forecasts. The company said results continue to be impacted by weak economic conditions around the world.

Biogen — The drug maker earned an adjusted $5.04 per share for its latest quarter, beating estimates by 8 cents.

Northrop saw better sales of in its aerospace systems business, which is involved in F-35 fighter jet production.    Stanley Black &amp; Decker — The tool maker earned $1.71 per share for its latest quarter, 3 cents above estimates, with revenue very slightly below forecasts. Its earnings were lower year over year, hurt by higher restructuring costs.    Whirlpool — The world's largest appliance maker missed estimates by 11 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of $4.33 per share, though revenue did slightly beat forecasts. Declining sales in the U.K. following the Brexit vote was among the factors hurting its results.    AT&amp;T — AT&amp;T matched estimates with adjusted quarterly profit of 66 cents per share, but missing on the top line as it continued to lose phone and video customers.    Johnson &amp; Johnson — J&amp;J struck a deal to buy European biotech company Actelion for $30 billion, after weeks of talks.    Qualcomm — Qualcomm earned $1.19 per share for its latest quarter, 1 cent above estimates, but the chipmaker's revenue fell below forecasts. Investors, however, remain concerned about lawsuits over its patent licensing practices and a recent South Korean government fine.    Las Vegas Sands — Las Vegas Sands missed estimates by 4 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of 62 cents per share, with the casino operator's revenue falling slightly short of forecasts as well. Results were impacted by results in Macau, which accounts for the majority of the company's business.    EBay — EBay posted quarterly results in line with forecasts at an adjusted 54 cents per share, while revenue was also in line with Street forecasts. The company did give a lighter than expected current quarter outlook, but made optimistic comments about its revamped platform.

Royal Bank of Scotland — The bank set aside nearly $4 billion for an expected settlement in the U.S. over the sale of mortgage-backed securities ahead of the 2008 financial crisis.    Diageo — Diageo posted better than expected quarterly sales, as the world's largest spirits maker saw improvements in its U.S. business.    Wal-Mart — The company escaped a possible $80 million fine when a judge refused to force the retailer to pay in a lawsuit involving California truck drivers. The jury had awarded the drivers more than $54 million in back pay, but the judge turned aside a motion for the extra penalty because he said the retailer had acted in good faith and believed it had been in compliance with California law.

SHLD,Sears Holdings Corporation,16:Department stores need to close 800 locations to restore their 2006 productivity,"Wednesday, 25 Jan 2017 | 11:48  AM ET","  Those 110 Sears and Macy's stores that have been marked for closure are only the beginning.    As department store chains cede market share to off-price, fast-fashion and online competitors, they would need to close about 800 locations to achieve their inflation-adjusted sales productivity level of 2006, according to Green Street's 2017 Mall Outlook.    That's the equivalent of all anchor space at 200 malls, or 20 percent of U.S. mall anchor space, according to the report.    Sears and J.C. Penney are the biggest culprits behind the industry's sales productivity gap, Green Street said in its report. Sears needs to close 44 percent of its stores to reach 2006 productivity levels, and Penney's needs to close 32 percent of its locations.   While Sears has been proactive in shuttering unprofitable stores, Penney's has been slower to trim its fleet. The company exited just seven locations last year. It has only four unprofitable stores, according to a separate report by Cowen and Company.     Penney's has not made any formal announcements about how many stores it will close this year. However, at a recent real estate conference in Dallas, CEO Marvin Ellison said the company will soon take action.    A J.C. Penney spokesperson reiterated that the company has not yet announced details regarding potential store closures in 2017.   In his research note, Cowen analyst Oliver Chen agreed that Penney's could eventually cut its fleet by roughly 30 percent, to free up money to invest in its best stores. That would leave it with some 700 locations.    ""It is uglier this year,"" Garrick Brown, vice president of retail research for the Americas at Cushman &amp; Wakefield, recently said about the bricks-and-mortar retail industry. ""I expect the closures to be worse, and I expect the malls to be hit more than any other shopping center type.""     This isn't the first time Green Street has called out the number of department stores that need to close to restore their previous productivity levels. Last year, the firm also concluded that roughly 800 stores needed to close, though the numbers varied for individual retailers.

PCLN,The Priceline Group Inc.,3:Cramer's game plan: Key signals to watch from Warren Buffett,"Friday, 24 Feb 2017 |  6:15  PM ET","Warren Buffett taught Jim Cramer, and many other investors, that the stock market is made up of stocks and not completely tied to politics or the averages. That's why when the market pulled back from its remarkable run on Friday, Cramer wasn't calling for a top. Instead, he will be watching the moves that individual companies make next week. ""If individual companies report good numbers, they can buck the top calling trend provided the economy remains as strong as we have seen since the year began,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. With this in mind, he outlined the stocks and events he will be watching next week.  Monday: Warren Buffett, Priceline Buffett: Cramer's eyes will be glued to the screen with Buffett's interview on CNBC on Monday. In particular, Cramer said to watch for Buffett's response to some of the biggest underperformers in his portfolio, like American Express, Coca-Cola, IBM and Wells Fargo. Priceline: This stock tends to be counted out over fears of travel, terrorism, Ebola or changes in U.S. immigration law. Each time, Priceline tends to overcome these concerns. Cramer thinks it will continue to do so. Tuesday: Domino's Pizza, Valeant Domino's Pizza: Cramer was concerned when Papa John's reported this week and discussed a pizza price war that is putting pressure on margins. The problem? Domino's was highlighted as the company that was most aggressive, and a price war is typically only good for short-sellers that could take the stock down when it reports. Valeant: If CEO Joe Papa has anything good to say, Cramer expects Valeant could join the recent pharmaceutical rally as investors are looking for a reason to buy the stock. For those investors looking to initiate a position, Cramer recommended to play Valeant with options to protect your downside. Wednesday: Best Buy, Dollar Tree Best Buy: Cramer is concerned its winning streak could be coming to an end with no new real games or hardware to keep the company afloat. Dollar Tree: Cramer openly admitted he's warming up to Dollar Tree. It is sourced almost 100 percent overseas and there isn't a tax on its merchandise. Again, Cramer recommended going with call options to protect the downside in case a border tax comes along one day. Thursday: Burlington Stores, Autodesk, Marvell Technology Burlington: The retail cohort is struggling, but not the off-price retail. After TJX reported a strong quarter and Burlington could deliver one, too. Autodesk, Marvell Technology: Cramer called these two stocks to own when they report on Thursday. Even if Marvell takes a breather after a big run, he thinks it could win either on a takeout or with earnings. Friday: Janet Yellen speaks Yellen is expected to speak about economic growth. Cramer needs to hear her make it clear that March is in play for a rate hike, as many investors now believe the economy is gaining steam in both the U.S. and abroad. ""The Fed should still hike short-term rates to stay ahead of a potential burst of economic strength,"" Cramer said.

DVMT,DVMT,3:Manufacturing CEOs go to President Trump for help in their fights against China,"Tuesday, 24 Jan 2017 | 10:23  AM ET","On his first full day in the Oval Office, President Trump gave face time to a group of major CEOs, and several had something in common: problems with China.   The meeting Monday came after an early morning tweet from the President announcing it. Without any details, most of the press was left guessing as to the attendees. Before the meeting, a stream of 12 CEOs from manufacturing companies walked into the White House.   
@realDonaldTrump: Busy week planned with a heavy focus on jobs and national security. Top executives coming in at 9:00 A.M. to talk manufacturing in America.
    Here's the final White House list of the CEOs that met Trump:    ""The scale of the challenge is pretty large,"" says Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, highlighting the technological and trade-related impediments to boosting manufacturing jobs in America.  Five of the 12 CEOs lead companies that are facing serious headwinds from China: U.S. Steel, Arconic (formerly Alcoa), Whirlpool, Corning and Under Armour. ""It's a great new dawn,"" Ed Rogers, chairman of the BGR group, a lobbying firm, told CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street.""    U.S. Steel: The company has been hit by a China-driven steel glut, and last April it accused Chinese government hackers of stealing proprietary technology.     Arconic (formerly Alcoa): The company has reeled under cheap Chinese aluminum supply for more than a decade. Chinese production and a strong dollar cut aluminum prices by 10 percent in 2015, the same year China produced 55 percent of the world's total supply. In fact, China's cheap exports drove CEO Kleinfeld's decision to split the company into two. The Obama administration lodged a WTO complaint into China's subsidies for its aluminum industry.    Whirlpool: The largest seller of household appliances has accused rivals some rivalsof making washing machines cheaply in China and selling them in the U.S. In response, the Commerce Department imposed anti-dumping tariffs on large residential washing machines sold by LG and Samsung but manufactured in China.    Corning: The maker of specialized LCD-glass screens reeled after China imposing anti-dumping tariffs on the company in the past.  Under Armour: Tech website Mashable was the first to report on a Chinese rip-off of Under Armour: ""Uncle Martian."" A Chinese disrespect for copyright laws is a major frustration facing American companies. Dow Chemicals: Despite a large presence in China, Dow's future holds intense competition from China National Chemical (ChemChina), a Chinese-owned chemical company, merging with Syngenta AG.

MTN,"Vail Resorts, Inc.",2:Final countdown to big jobs Friday — and a rate hike,"Thursday,  9 Mar 2017 |  4:49  PM ET","Regardless of what Friday's jobs report shows, analysts say the Federal Reserve is intent on raising interest rates next week.  The highly anticipated employment report is due for release Friday morning. The consensus forecast of analysts polled by Reuters estimates a rise of 190,000 nonfarm payrolls in February, down from 227,000 in January. The unemployment rate is expected to edge down from 4.8 percent to 4.7 percent, while average hourly earnings are forecast to increase 0.3 percent from the prior month. ""It's going to be hard for this report to be a negative in terms of rate hikes,"" said Diane Swonk of DS Economics. She estimates a hiring freeze in the federal government will take about 10,000 from the total as no replacements come in for retiring workers. That puts her estimate on the low end at 160,000 jobs, still enough for the Fed to raise rates in March. ""What's important to remember is the threshold is very low for the Fed,"" she said. ""That is something we have to get used to.""  Fed Chair Janet Yellen noted last week that net new monthly jobs are well above the longer-run trend in labor force growth between 75,000 and 125,000. As a result, Yellen said, the labor market is in the range of the Fed's employment goal and policymakers consider ""it appropriate to move toward a neutral policy stance."" The Federal Open Market Committee meets next Tuesday and Wednesday, and is expected to raise rates for the third time in just about a decade. Traders are now focused on whether the Fed will signal a faster pace of tightening.  Paul Christopher, head global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, expects the two rate hikes this year, below the consensus for three.  ""If it's a really strong report, plus 200 [thousand] again, the market may start to decide to rethink whether its priced in enough economic improvement for the year,"" he said. But ""the odds we see the economy are going to be stronger than 2.3, 2.4 [percent growth] this year are slim. I think it's more likely the economy remains predictable — and therefore already priced in — and the [federal government] policy disappoints."" Expectations for a solid, if not strong, jobs number are high. After the private payrolls report came in well above expectations at 298,000 on Wednesday, Goldman Sachs raised its estimate to 215,000 and UBS increased its forecast to 225,000.  Economists generally attributed the strong report to warmer weather, which spurred job creation in areas such as construction. Joe Seydl, economist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank, expects that for the headline nonfarm payrolls figure, ""at least 50 to 60,000 of it will be driven by warm weather."" ""It's getting tough to decipher the underlying trend when you remove the weather factor,"" he said. Treasury yields have climbed steadily in the last week. Markets reacted positively to President Donald Trump's conventional address to Congress, while an array of Fed speakers including Yellen talked up the likelihood of a March rate hike. The U.S. 2-year Treasury note yield, which is most sensitive to near-term expectations on Fed policy, on Thursday held near highs not seen since the summer of 2009. The 10-year yield hit 2.607 percent, its highest since mid-December. The 10-year yield has held in a range since the election and struggled to trade much above 2.6 percent. ""The number tomorrow could break them out of that range if wages really take a big step,"" said John Bredemus, vice president at Allianz Investment Management. That said, U.S. stocks remain focused on promises of pro-growth policies from the Trump administration.  ""It's very hard to get this market to go down when expectations are so focused on what's going to come out of policy in Washington,"" said Peter Coleman, head trader at Convergex. The S&amp;P 500 squeezed out a nearly 2-point gain to close around 2,364.9 despite a continued drop in oil prices. Health care led advancers, while real estate was the worst performing sector.  U.S. crude oil extended Wednesday's plunge to settle at $49.28 a barrel on Thursday, its lowest since Nov. 29. The weekly oil rig count is scheduled for release Friday afternoon. The Treasury budget is the only other major economic report set for release Friday. Vail Resorts is due to post earnings before the open.

MAT,"Mattel, Inc.",7:Hasbro’s CEO reveals how the heck they just crushed earnings,"Monday,  6 Feb 2017 |  6:25  PM ET","As shares of Hasbro skyrocketed 14 percent on Monday, the company's CEO Brian Goldner explained that the success could be seen right in the brand blueprint. ""It's all about engaging the consumer across storytelling and innovation, a lot of digital engagement. We do it all around the world,"" Goldner told ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer on Monday. ""Our international business, category for category and region for region, we are up considerably."" Hasbro has the exclusive rights to make toys, games and action figures, thanks to a valuable partnership with Disney. It covers well-known franchises movies such as ""Star Wars"", ""Frozen"" and the older brands such as Nerf and My Little Pony. Goldner explained that the company relies on proprietary consumer insights to get a clear sense of what customers really want. They use the feedback to guide product development and create entertainment experiences for fans around the brands they like. The company reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.64 a share, versus the $1.27 expected by Wall Street. It also had substantially higher than expected revenue, up 11 percent year over year. Historically, Hasbro has focused on making toys for boys, but this quarter marked a pivot from that approach as the girls category, which includes the Disney princess line, grew 52 percent year over year. Cramer attributed some of the success to the fact that it took over the Disney doll business from Mattel. This came just in time for the company's robust breakdown of earnings, as it chose to stop reporting only data from the perspective of girls and boys. Instead, it now reports based on emerging brands, partner brands, gaming and franchise brands. ""We also felt like it really wasn't contemporary. It's not the way we look at our business to look at boys and girls anymore. So many of our brands are gender inclusive. If you play Nerf, you could be a boy or a girl. If you love 'Star Wars', you are a boy or a girl. You could be anybody,"" Goldner said. Questions for Cramer? Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC Want to take a deep dive into Cramer's world? Hit him up!

TLT,iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF,1:Trader bets against bonds ahead of Fed meeting,"Tuesday, 28 Feb 2017 |  1:03  PM ET","With some predictions of a March rate hike now as high as 50 percent, one trader is betting against bonds ahead of this month's highly anticipated Fed meeting. The 20+ year U.S. Treasury bond-tracking ETF (TLT) has climbed about 1 percent in the past week, but Todd Gordon of TradingAnalysis.com believes that given the likelihood of a March rate hike, which could be announced on March 15 following the meeting, bond prices are actually set to fall. To determine how far bonds could fall, Gordon takes a look at the TLT over the past few months. In a chart of TLT dating back to last July, Gordon points out that the ETF had seen a ""decline for some period of time"" and since the start of the year, has been in a ""sideways consolidation."" Given that the trader believes bonds will fall since the chances of a March rate hike have risen, Gordon actually wants to use this trading range to short bonds. ""We're in a period of consolidation here, and it looks like we have formed resistance on the top side that we can lean against to establish those shorts,"" he said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation.""  The range, according to Gordon, lies between the $122 mark on the upside and around $118 on the downside. In other words, Gordon sees TLT dropping as much as 3 percent in the short term.   As a result, Gordon wants to buy the March monthly 121-strike puts and sell the March monthly 118-strike puts expiring March 17, just days after the Fed meeting. His total cost for the trade is $1, and he could make a maximum reward of $2 if TLT closes below $118 on March 17.","[With, prediction, March, rate, hike, percent, trader, betting, ahead, highly, anticipated, Fed, meeting, The, U, S, Treasury, tracking, ETF, TLT, climbed, percent, past, Todd, Gordon, TradingAnalysis, com, belief, given, likelihood, March, rate, hike, announced, March, With, prediction, March, rate, hike, percent, trader, betting, ahead, highly, anticipated, Fed, meeting, The, U, S, Treasury, tracking, ETF, TLT, climbed, percent, past, Todd, Gordon, TradingAnalysis, com, belief, given, likelihood, March, rate, hike, announced, March, following, With, prediction, March, rate, hike, percent, trader, betting, ahead, highly, anticipated, Fed, meeting, The, U, S, Treasury, tracking, ETF, TLT, climbed, percent, past, Todd, Gordon, TradingAnalysis, com, belief, given, ...]",1.0

Rio Tinto, which is a partner in Freeport's massive Grasberg copper and gold mine in Indonesia, is also supportive of Freeport's tougher approach toward Jakarta, CEO Richard Adkerson said. In some of his strongest language yet on the issue, Adkerson said the new regulations sought by Indonesia were ""in effect a form of expropriation of our assets and we are resisting it aggressively."" ""Many of our shareholders feel that we have been too nice. Now we are in the position of standing up for our rights under the contract,"" Adkerson told a mining conference of institutional investors in Hollywood, Florida. He said Freeport had held talks with large shareholders but did not name them. Freeport's third-biggest shareholder is activist investor Carl Icahn, who holds around 7 percent of its shares. Icahn has been appointed a special adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump. Freeport, the world's biggest publicly listed copper producer, warned last week it could take the Indonesian government to arbitration and seek damages over a contractual dispute that has halted operations and exports at Grasberg, the world's second-biggest copper mine.  The dispute, which centers around the sanctity of Freeport's 30-year mining contract, comes as the Indonesian government seeks to squeeze more revenue out of the mining industry by shaking up regulations over foreign ownership and ore processing. The two sides have 120 days to settle their differences before heading to arbitration. ""The polite approach that we have had in the past, if we go to arbitration, is going to be replaced with tough lawyers,"" Adkerson said. He added that he hoped the dispute could be resolved cooperatively although the Indonesian government has so far ""responded aggressively through ministers."" Freeport's inability to export copper since mid-January, coupled with a strike at BHP Billiton's Escondida in Chile, the world's biggest copper mine, has pushed copper prices to 20-month highs of $6,204 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange this month. In the face of the export halt, Freeport last week said it was proceeding with its plan to reduce production at Grasberg by about 60 percent, make significant cuts to its workforce and suspend investments in the province of Papua.

CVX,Chevron Corporation,12:Chevron shares drop as oil giant badly misses profit forecasts,"Friday, 27 Jan 2017 | 11:47  AM ET","  Shares of Chevron gave up about 2 percent of their value in pre-market trading Friday as the oil giant turned in quarterly results that badly missed estimates.    Chevron executives pointed to lower margins in its refining business and tax charges as drags on earnings during a conference call. They also said layoffs were largely behind them, but the company would continue looking for ways to drive down costs. The company also said it will be able to fund spending and dividends in 2017 with cash generated from operations, following a downturn that forced oil giants and smaller drillers alike to tap debt and other to sources to pay for normal business operations.   ""Our 2016 earnings reflect the low oil and gas prices we saw during the year,"" Chairman and CEO John Watson said in a statement. ""We responded aggressively to those conditions, cutting capital and operating expenses by $14 billion.""     Chief Financial Officer Patricia Yarrington said on the conference call Chevron is considering more assets sales. ""Additional opportunities are in progress and many will close in 2017,"" she said.    Last month, the company said it would lower its capital spending for a fourth consecutive year. Chevron's $19.8 billion program for 2017 will focus on projects with shorter cycles and higher returns aimed at producing oil and gas within two years.    That includes more drilling in the the U.S. Permian basin, located in Texas and New Mexico, which is leading the nation's shale oil recovery, Watson said. The company said it was operating 10 oil rigs in the region and planning to add another about every eight weeks, he said on Friday.   Chevron also provided updates on its critical Gorgon liquefied natural gas project, which experienced some shutdowns in 2016, as well as its Wheatstone natural gas hub.  Watson acknowledged the first phase of Gorgon's ramp-up missed expectations and said Chevron would apply those lessons to future phases there and at Wheatstone. He said the next phase of Gorgon would start processing LNG early in the second quarter. Phase one of Wheatstone is scheduled for mid-2017, with phase two expected six to eight months later.   The company reported fourth-quarter earnings of $415 million, or 22 cents a share, on revenue of $31.5 billion. Analysts had expected Chevron to earn 64 cents on revenue of $33.3 billion, according to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters.    In the year-ago period, Chevron reported a loss of $588 million, or 31 cents a share, shortly before oil prices hit 12-year lows.    Low crude oil and gas prices throughout much of 2016 pushed the oil giant to a loss for the year. For 2016, Chevron reported a loss of $497 million, or 27 cents a share.    Cash flow, a key measure of corporate health in the oil and gas industry, was $12.8 billion in 2016, down from $19.5 billion the previous year.    Chevron spent $22.4 billion on capital projects and exploration last year, down from $34 billion in 2015, reflecting the industry trend of reducing expenses to weather the downturn.     Chevron saw results improve from the year-ago period in its upstream business, which includes exploration and production of fossil fuels. The company chalked that up to lower exploration and operating expenses and its oil and gas fetching a higher price.    Oil prices stabilized above $50 a barrel in the fourth quarter after OPEC and other major oil producers agreed to cut production.    In the downstream segment, which includes refining and marketing fuel, Chevron saw fourth-quarter profits slide both in the United States and abroad. The company broke even in its U.S. downstream business, compared with profits of $496 million a year ago.    Integrated oil companies such as Chevron have seen their refining margins shrink on the rising price of crude oil, the raw material for many fuels. Throughout much of the oil price downturn that began in 2014, low crude costs boosted refining margins.    Revenues for the quarter were $30 billion, up 7 percent from sales of $28 billion a year ago.      On Wednesday, the San Ramon, California-based oil giant announced a quarterly dividend of $1.08 a share, unchanged from the previous quarter, when it hiked the shareholder payout by a penny.

While Snap cautioned it had no binding commitments yet from investors accepting such a lock-up period, the disclosure is a sign of confidence from the company in what is expected to be the biggest U.S. IPO since Facebook. Lock-up periods help companies moderate stock volatility by preventing company insiders from selling their shares within an allotted time. A year-long lock-up period is atypically long, potentially signifying strong demand for the IPO. Snap is targeting a valuation of between $19.5 billion and $22.3 billion from listing on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. It is looking to price 200 million shares on Wednesday night at a range of $14 to $16 dollars a share. Orders for the IPO have begun to come in at the high-end of its range, and its ""book"" is already oversubscribed, according to people familiar with the process who requested anonymity. In its updated IPO registration document with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Snap said it expected approximately 50 million shares of its Class A common stock purchased by investors in the offering to be subject to a separate one-year lock-up agreement. The roughly 50 million shares are designated for new Snap IPO investors who do not currently have a stake in the company, the sources said. Lock-up periods can buoy companies at risk of a stock selloff in the months following their IPO. This risk is particularly strong for companies in the technology sector.

In a 52 to 47 vote, the Senate approved a resolution already passed by the House of Representatives that wipes from the books a rule requiring companies such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron to publicly state the taxes and other fees they pay to foreign governments.    Republican President Donald Trump is expected to sign it shortly.     Exxon and other major energy corporations have fought for years to prevent the rule, required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law, from seeing the light of day.    After a series of legal battles, the Securities and Exchange Commission in June 2016 completed the regulation, which supporters say can help expose questionable financial ties U.S. companies may have with foreign governments.    Democrats in the Senate had raised concerns during debate late on Wednesday that Exxon's chief executive during those legal fights was Rex Tillerson, recently confirmed as Secretary of State, the country's top diplomatic post.    Tillerson, who has done extensive business in Russia, had raised Democrats' hackles at his confirmation hearing by saying he did not know Exxon had lobbied against U.S. sanctions on Russia.    ""It should be lost on no one that in less than 48 hours, the Republican-controlled Senate has confirmed the former head of ExxonMobil to serve as our Secretary of State, and repealed a key anti-corruption rule that ExxonMobil and the American Petroleum Institute have erroneously fought for years,"" said Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the foreign relations committee.

RUTH,"Ruth's Hospitality Group, Inc.","2:While restaurants struggle, steakhouses are thriving — here's why","Friday, 20 Jan 2017 |  8:00  AM ET","  While restaurants have struggled in the last year to keep sales positive, one sector is thriving: steakhouses.    Across the board in 2016, restaurants have seen a slowdown in traffic due to a combination of economic uncertainty, market saturation and a decline in at-home food costs. These factors are straining sales, which are expected to grow only 1 percent year over year in 2017.    ""Steakhouses outperform other full-service chains,"" Darren Tristano, president of food consulting firm Technomic, told CNBC. He said these restaurants are more insulated against headwinds that typically affect fast food chains, like higher gas prices and unemployment.    There are four key reasons steakhouses are poised for success:    Steakhouses often attract a more affluent consumer base and offer food that is considered a premium meal.    While a steak at Outback Steakhouse will cost you $15 to $35 depending on the size of the cut of meat, a steak at an upscale steakhouse like Morton's starts at $45 and can run higher than $125. And that's just for one diner.    ""People don't mind paying a little bit more for a good high quality meal,"" BTIG restaurant analyst Peter Salah told CNBC. ""[In addition,] steakhouses have been seeing more benefit on the bottom line because steak prices have been coming down, so their margins have been improving.""    Not only is steak a high-priced item, but the majority of steakhouses also offer seafood, which boosts check prices.    Aaron Allen, founder and CEO of global restaurant consulting firm Aaron Allen and Associates, said full-service casual restaurants have been on a steady decline. ""For years now, the worse place to be in the restaurant business is a full-service restaurant with a check average of less than $20,"" he said.   In addition to catering to affluent customers, many steakhouses have incorporated business-friendly rooms for corporations to host events or meetings, Tristano said.    Morton's, Ruth's Chris, The Capital Grille and Fleming's are among steakhouse chains that offer private dining with customized menus and audiovisual technology for presentations.    ""Our private meeting rooms accommodate groups large and small and are ideal for seminars, presentations, conferences, client dinners and other corporate events,"" Morton's touts on its website.     These private rooms are appealing to those hoping to close a deal, impress a new client or host a corporate dinner.    Of course, you don't need a six-figure salary to go to a steakhouse. Many people see these restaurants as places to celebrate special occasions.   ""Even in somewhat uncertain economic environments, we've found guests will seek out great experiences for occasion-based dining like birthdays, anniversaries or any kind of celebratory event,"" Larry Johnson, CEO of Fogo de Chao, told CNBC. In addition to steak and seafood sales, steakhouses are also making money off of alcoholic beverages.  Tristano estimated that about 30 percent of sales for these types of chains come from beer, wine and cocktails.  ""Some of these steakhouses that are doing really well have reconfigured to allocate more space towards the bar area than the dining room,"" Allen said, noting that there is now less stigma attached to solo diners, and those consumers gravitate toward the bar area to eat and drink.","[like, Morton, start, run, higher, And, diner, People, mind, paying, bit, quality, meal, BTIG, restaurant, analyst, Peter, Salah, told, CNBC, In, addition, steakhouse, seeing, benefit, bottom, line, steak, price, coming, margin, improving, Not, steak, priced, item, majority, steakhouse, offer, seafood, Allen, Associates, said, full, service, casual, restaurant, steady, decline, For, year, worse, restaurant, business, full, service, restaurant, check, average, said, In, addition, catering, affluent, customer, steakhouse, incorporated, business, friendly, room, corporation, host, event, meeting, Tristano, said, Morton, Ruth, Chris, The, check, average, said, In, addition, catering, affluent, customer, steakhouse, incorporated, business, friendly, room, corporation, host, event, meeting, Tristano, said, Morton, ...]",1.0
JWN,"Nordstrom, Inc.",11:How machines can help investors make money from President Trump’s tweets,"Friday, 10 Feb 2017 | 12:54  AM ET","For investors hoping to cash in on President Donald Trump's market-moving tweets, monitoring his Twitter feed constantly is essential. The slightest delay in reaction could be the difference between making a quick profit and losing money. Rachel Mayer, a former JPMorgan trader, believes there's an easier way: let software do it. Her start-up created an app, where an algorithm scans the President's tweets for mentions of specific publicly-traded companies. Whenever Trump tweets about the companies, the app can send push notifications to alert users. These are called 'triggers.' ""It's purely an informational tool,"" Mayer, who is CEO and co-founder of Trigger, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Friday. The triggers are created based on ""if this then that"" type of statements and can help to guide investment decisions. For example, if Trump tweets about CNN and his tweet is about a fake news allegation, then a notification can be sent to alert users who own Time Warner - the parent company of CNN - stocks in their portfolios.

DKS,Dick's Sporting Goods Inc,1:Here's why Dick's Sporting Goods won't suffer the same fate as Sports Authority,"Tuesday,  7 Mar 2017 |  1:05  PM ET","After scooping up market share that its bankrupt competitors left behind, Ed Stack, CEO of Dick's Sporting Goods, took a step back to diagnose the health of its core business. His conclusion? While the sporting goods chain doesn't suffer the same ""symptoms of the disease"" that his competitors ""atrophied from and died,"" that doesn't mean it can sit idly by. On a call with investors after Dick's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report, Stack outlined how his company will continue grabbing share amid consolidation in the industry. His strategy includes opening stores in markets where competitors' bankruptcies left a gap, and targeting new customers in its existing markets where one of those chains has failed. Meanwhile, Dick's is looking to strengthen its assortment by cutting 20 percent of its lower-volume vendors to focus on its most important suppliers, and lean harder into its private brands.  The company's plans weren't enough to appease investors, who sent its shares nearly 9 percent lower. The sell-off came on the back of a disappointing first-quarter earnings outlook, and concerns that Dick's market share gains would not persist to the same degree in the second half of the year. ""The consolidation in this industry's not over,"" Stack said. At a time when many retailers are shuttering stores, Dick's this fiscal year will open 43 locations under that nameplate, 19 of which are former Sports Authority stores. These shops will primarily target California, Texas and the Pacific Northwest, where Dick's has a small footprint.  Stack said the company will be ""patient"" in site selection for future expansion, with retailers like Macy's, J.C. Penney and others marking hundreds of large stores for closure. He meanwhile expects more market share to come up for grabs in the sporting goods industry, on top of the lift it's received from the recent wind downs of The Sports Authority, Sport Chalet and Golfsmith chains. Though he did not mention specific companies, the recent sale of Finish Line's 65 Jack Rabbit running stores — purchased for $0  — shows how competitive the crowded sporting goods market has become. Investors have grown more cautious on the athletic goods space as a result of these struggles, and recent weakness at brands including Under Armour. ""There were some weak links and some companies that couldn't survive,"" Stack said, speaking to their high debt levels and lack of investment in their stores and online. ""I don't think this is something we get caught up in as long as we continue to manage and run our business."" To differentiate itself from its remaining competitors, Dick's is trimming its 1,600-strong vendor list by 20 percent to focus on its most important accounts. It will do so, for instance, by giving them additional square footage, while securing exclusive product for its stores.  The company took a $46 million write-down in the fiscal fourth quarter to eliminate the merchandise it will no longer carry. None of the retailer's top 10 vendors will be cut from its stores, Stack said, declining to provide more specifics. According to the chain's latest 10-K filing, Nike represented 20 percent of Dick's inventory in the year ended Jan. 30, 2016. It was followed by Under Armour at 12 percent.  Meanwhile, Dick's plans to beef up its private-label business by launching two new brands and expanding its existing labels. ""This is a sensible step,"" Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, told investors, adding that the stores' assortments are sometimes ""a little jumbled and undisciplined."" ""Some pruning should remedy this, and we believe it will reduce costs as well as deepening relationships with strategic partners, which will allow it to create differentiated products,"" Saunders said.","[After, scooping, market, share, bankrupt, competitor, left, Ed, Stack, CEO, Dick, Sporting, Goods, took, step, diagnose, health, business, His, conclusion, While, sporting, good, chain, suffer, symptom, disease, competitor, atrophied, died, After, scooping, market, share, bankrupt, competitor, left, Ed, Stack, CEO, Dick, Sporting, Goods, took, step, diagnose, health, business, His, conclusion, While, sporting, good, chain, suffer, symptom, disease, competitor, atrophied, died, mean, After, scooping, market, share, bankrupt, competitor, left, Ed, Stack, CEO, Dick, Sporting, Goods, took, step, diagnose, health, business, His, conclusion, While, sporting, good, chain, suffer, symptom, disease, competitor, atrophied, died, mean, sit, diagnose, health, business, His, conclusion, While, sporting, ...]",1.0

""Because if you listen to the commentary of these companies, you would say, 'You know what, it's a different game,''"" he said. On Tuesday, investors digested several quarterly results reports, including retail giants Macy's, Home Depot and Wal-Mart.

NEWR,"New Relic, Inc.",1:Cramer Remix: Why Apple is proof worries about Trump are overblown,"Monday, 13 Feb 2017 |  7:28  PM ET","Jim Cramer has a message for all of the doubters of the market rally out there: stop thinking this is a rally. Instead, realize that this is a sea change, where the market is no longer influenced by the things that used hold it back before President Donald Trump won the election. Technology stocks in particular have roared since the election, with Apple hitting a new closing high on Monday. So much of the rally has roots that started in Silicon Valley, Cramer said. Thus, the price of Apple's stock is not determined by the White House. Yes, it has a large cash hoard overseas that could benefit from Trump's agenda of repatriation, but that's not the main thing powering Apple higher. ""What is really driving the stock of Apple is something quite different. A realization that Apple's worldwide sales are coming in better than expected, its service revenue stream is on fire and its design and manufacturing supremacy is leaving long-time competitor Samsung in the dust,"" Cramer said. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said that regardless of the administration in the White House, it is important to have an open dialogue and to build a relationship in every country that his company operates in. Krzanich met with President Trump on Feb. 8 and followed the meeting with an announcement that Intel would invest $7 billion in a factory that will employ up to 3,000 people in Chandler, Arizona. The investment would complete plans for a plant that was previously started. According to Krzanich, Trump's position on taxes is what inspired him to revive the factory. Under the current tax system in the U.S., relative to overseas, Krzanich said it would cost approximately $2 billion more over the span of 10 years. ""The tax plan that the administration is putting forward would drastically reduce that … we are betting on that tax plan coming into fruition,"" Krzanich said. As the transformation of technology continues to span the globe, VMware COO Sanjay Poonen told Jim Cramer on Monday that the company is watching the ""America First"" stance of immigration in U.S. very closely. ""Our general philosophy is software changes the world … software is our birthright — Silicon Valley, and the United States — it is the reason people like me are here,"" Poonen said. Poonen immigrated to the United States from India in 1987 to attend Dartmouth College on a scholarship, and moved to Silicon Valley in 1991. As VMware continues to be the global leader in cloud infrastructure and virtualization, Poonen considers the opportunity for immigration to the U.S. to be very important. Cloud-based software company New Relic also launched a partnership with Amazon Web Services. New Relic specializes in helping their clients monitor and measure what their business software is doing and how users interact with it in real time. Its analytics engine provides a sophisticated dashboard for companies to provide insight into their digital operations. Cramer spoke with New Relic's CEO Lew Cirne, who explained that there are two big trends happening right now in enterprise software. The first trend is the digital imperative to reach customers. The second is the secular move to the cloud as companies exit the data center business. ""While these big changes are happening, they need a dashboard to see how their software is running in the cloud … New Relic's dashboard plus the new infrastructure platforms provided by cloud providers helps enterprises make that migration,"" Cirne said. If one thing is certain for Cramer, it is that metal and copper stocks continue to roar higher, reaching levels not seen in the last two years. However, that doesn't mean Cramer recommends investing in these stocks. ""I say you can trade the metal stocks, but not invest in them,"" Cramer said. Ultimately, he thinks that the stocks can only rally so far before they hit a wall looking for growth. And right now, growth is getting hard to find. In the Lightning Round, Cramer gave his take on a few stocks from callers: Chesapeake Energy Corporation: ""I think it's the year of natural gas. People just don't realize it because we've had such warm weather and I do think that Chesapeake is a buy right here at $6."" Ubiquiti Networks Inc: ""They missed the quarter badly and in a lot of different ways. Therefore, I can't recommend it. It's in the penalty box. We've got to wait for the next quarter.""","[Silicon, Valley, As, VMware, continues, global, leader, infrastructure, virtualization, Poonen, considers, opportunity, immigration, U, S, important, Cloud, based, software, company, New, Relic, launched, partnership, Amazon, Web, Services, New, Relic, specializes, helping, client, monitor, measure, business, software, user, interact, time, Its, Valley, As, VMware, continues, global, leader, infrastructure, virtualization, Poonen, considers, opportunity, immigration, U, S, important, Cloud, based, software, company, New, Relic, launched, partnership, Amazon, Web, Services, New, Relic, specializes, helping, client, monitor, measure, business, software, user, interact, time, Its, analytics, infrastructure, virtualization, Poonen, considers, opportunity, immigration, U, S, important, Cloud, based, software, company, New, Relic, launched, partnership, Amazon, Web, Services, ...]",1.0

    Overbought: Many S&P 500 stocks have already reached their 12-month price forecasts from Wall Street","	  Thursday, 23 Feb 2017 |  4:00  PM ET","More than 20 percent of the S&amp;P 500 components have rallied so much during this record-setting market run that they are already trading at or above the 12-month price target set by uber-bullish Wall Street analysts. These overbought stocks could be due for a fall unless Wall Street radically revises up its forecast in the coming days. It could also be a sign that the market overall is overvalued.  Since the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8, the S&amp;P 500 index is up 10 percent, as investors bet that President Donald Trump's campaign promises of lower corporate taxes, deregulation and increased fiscal stimulus could spark a new wave of growth among S&amp;P companies. After the rally, there are 116 S&amp;P 500 members whose stock price is now above the consensus price forecast from analysts on the Street.  ""Equity market valuations are stretched,"" BMO's chief investment officer, Jack Ablin, wrote in a note to clients Thursday.

Honeywell did reaffirm its prior 2017 earnings outlook.    General Dynamics — The defense contractor beat estimates by 10 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of $2.62 per share, though revenue fell below forecasts. The company calls the quarter ""solid"" and notes an increase in profit margins.    Comcast — The NBCUniversal parent was downgraded to ""sector weight"" from ""overweight"" at Pacific Crest, saying the current valuation fails to reflect increased competitive risk.    American Airlines — The airline matched estimates, earning an adjusted 92 cents per share, while revenue beat estimates. The company also approved a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization.    Ford — The automaker's stock was upgraded to ""outperform"" from ""sector form"" at RBC Capital following Thursday's earnings report and subsequent stock price drop. RBC said expectations surrounding Ford are low and that the next earnings revision is likely to be higher.    Colgate-Palmolive — The consumer products maker reported adjusted quarterly profit of 75 cents per share, in line with estimates, but revenue fell below forecasts. Colgate's overall pricing came in higher, but total sales were lower compared to a year earlier.    Intel — The chipmaker beat estimates by 5 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of 79 cents per share. Revenue also beat forecasts as the PC market stabilized and demand increased for Intel's data center services.

GT,The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company,4:Back to the future: A visual tour of the Dow 30 index,None,"By John W. Schoen The history of the Dow Jones industrial average is a history of the U.S. economy. This visualization tracks the companies that, over the past 88 years, have entered and left the iconic index as their fortunes rose and fell.    While the Dow tracks the stock prices of its 30 elite members, this visualization illustrates the total value of each company, as measured by monthly average market capitalization (the number of shares outstanding multiplied by the stock price).   The roster continues to reflect the ongoing evolution of the American economy. From a developing economy that drew heavily on commodity production and extraction — American Sugar, Standard Oil and U.S. Steel — the Dow 30 membership tracked the rise of manufacturing through the middle of the last century — Goodyear, Boeing, General Motors — and the more recent emergence of an economy driven by information, finance and services industries: Visa, Microsoft and Verizon.    If past is prologue, the Dow roster will look very different in 25 years. Of the 30 current stocks, less than half were members 25 years ago. Only five have maintained membership for 50 years, and only one — General Electric — has been a Dow stock since the index expanded to 30 companies on Oct. 1, 1928.  In 25 years some of today's iconic companies will likely have faded away like an old Kodak photo, or closed up shop like a Woolworth's lunch counter.    And there will likely be whole new industries whose contributions to the U.S. economy will be represented on the Dow.   So while you can expect the list to take on an entirely new set of names, it's difficult — if not impossible — to predict what they'll be.

SHLD,Sears Holdings Corporation,15:Sears shares tumble to their lowest price since Kmart merger,"Thursday, 26 Jan 2017 |  3:26  PM ET","  Sears shares tumbled more than 9 percent on Thursday, sending the company's stock to its lowest price since its merger with Kmart back in 2004.    The decline piled on to a 7 percent drop in Sears' shares a day earlier, when Fitch Ratings called attention to the chain's ""significant"" cash burn. Sears shares were last trading below $8, highlighting the severe financial strain the company is under as sales continue to erode.  In a downgrade of Sears' senior unsecured notes on Wednesday, Fitch said the company's interest expense, capital expenditures and pension plan contributions are expected to total $800 million for 2016. They could potentially hit $1 billion in 2017.     The ratings agency expects Sears to burn through $1.6 billion in cash in 2016, and $1.8 billion in 2017. Those numbers assume $250 million in annual working capital benefits from closing stores and trimming down inventories.    Meanwhile, Fitch anticipates Sears will report a loss of $950 million to $1 billion in 2016 and 2017. That would be wider than 2015's $836 million loss.    Fitch noted that Sears has injected almost $12 billion in liquidity into its business from 2012 to 2016, in an attempt to plug the hole it created through continuous sales declines. The retailer's recent financial maneuvers include selling its Craftsman business to Stanley Black &amp; Decker and closing 150 unprofitable Sears and Kmart stores.     But with Sears' real estate portfolio shrinking to an estimated 190 unencumbered Kmart and Sears stores, Fitch said the company is running low on assets.    The agency's report came just days after Moody's downgraded Sears' corporate rating.     ""Although Sears has been able to fund its continued cash shortfalls through planned asset monetization, and additional financings, a meaningful business turnaround in fiscal 2017 is critical given the continued reduction of its asset base,"" Moody's Vice President Christina Boni said in a statement.

KO,Coca-Cola Company (The),3:These 33 stocks have missed the 'Trump Bump' — twice,"Friday, 17 Feb 2017 |  2:36  PM ET","There's little doubt that stocks are in rally mode. The election of President Donald Trump has investors hopeful that lighter regulation and lower corporate tax rates will mean big things for their bottom lines.  The S&amp;P 500 overall is up nearly 10 percent since the close of trading on Election Day in November. But this rally is coming in two phases: Phase 1 is the period between the election and inauguration day. That's followed by Phase 2, the period between inauguration and now. Almost every stock was up in at least one of the two periods. But a few stocks stand out — the ones that dropped both after the election and after the inauguration. These ones missed the ""Trump bump"" twice. Take a look at some of the big household names that aren't benefiting from the rising tide: Coke, Monster and Gilead Sciences. There are a few retail stocks in the mix: Gap, Ralph Lauren and Under Armour. Mondelez and General Mills are consumer foods companies that were down Phase 1 but had recovered somewhat, only to drop at the last minute on Thursday. Shares of Mondelez fell 1.3 percent between the election and inauguration day, largely on concerns about the company's global exposure and currency exchange volatility. It had gained back some ground, buoyed by 2017 guidance for ""at least"" 1 percent growth and an operating margin north of 16 percent, according to Stifel Nicolaus analysts. The company dropped overnight Thursday after Kraft Heinz said it would continue exploring a merger with Unilever. The Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant rejected Kraft's proposed $143 billion merger. Under Armour's CEO Kevin Plank made headlines in recent weeks, calling Trump a ""real asset"" to the country, only to walk the comment back slightly after UA spokesman Steph Curry snapped back about the president. The company's 30 percent slide since the election continues its downward trajectory since September 2015. In fourth quarter earnings, management lowered overall revenue growth forecast for 2017 to 11-12 percent, down from the low 20s. Analysts at Argus lowered EPS estimates for the year from $0.74 to $0.50. Coca Cola shares have fallen slightly from their Nov. 8 level of $43. The company raised its dividend for the 55th straight year on Thursday, by 6 percent. Now at $0.37 per share a quarter, yielding around 3.5 percent annually. The company's global presence is a boon for the brand, but could also be a liability: Some 54 percent of revenue comes from outside the U.S. and could be affected by any currency exchange swings that come from American protectionist trade policies.","[There, doubt, rally, mode, The, election, President, Donald, Trump, investor, hopeful, lighter, regulation, corporate, tax, rate, mean, big, thing, bottom, line, The, S, amp, doubt, rally, mode, The, election, President, Donald, Trump, investor, hopeful, lighter, regulation, corporate, tax, rate, mean, big, thing, bottom, line, The, S, amp, P, overall, nearly, percent, trading, Election, Day, November, But, rally, coming, phase, Phase, period, election, inauguration, That, company, global, exposure, currency, exchange, volatility, It, gained, ground, buoyed, guidance, percent, growth, operating, margin, percent, according, Stifel, Nicolaus, analyst, The, company, dropped, overnight, Thursday, Kraft, Heinz, said, continue, exploring, merger, Unilever, The, Anglo, Dutch, consumer, ...]",1.0

MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,44:Bill Gates could become the world's first trillionaire,"	  Monday, 23 Jan 2017 | 12:27  PM ET","  In our lifetimes, we could see the first trillionaire. And, most likely, that first trillionaire would be Microsoft  co-founder Bill Gates.  That's according to research by Oxfam, an international network of organizations collectively working to alleviate global poverty. Its recently published report finds that eight billionaires from around the globe have as much money as the 3.6 billion people who make up the poorest half of the world's population.      The report also finds that, given the exponential growth of existing wealth,  the world could have its first trillionaire in the next 25 years, when Gates would be 86. When Gates left Microsoft in 2006, his net worth was $50 billion, according to Oxfam. By 2016, his wealth had increased to $75 billion, ""despite his commendable attempts to give it away through his Foundation,"" the report says.   In addition to the charitable work Gates does through his personal foundation, he is one of the founding members of The Giving Pledge, a commitment from some of the richest individuals in the world to give away more than half of their worth.    For the hypothetical analysis, Oxfam researchers apply the average rate of growth the ultra-rich have been enjoying, 11 percent per year since 2009, to Gates' current levels of wealth (over $84 billion, according to Forbes). If his investments keep doing as well as they have been, the 61-year-old Gates could indeed become the world's first trillionaire.    ""In such an environment, if you are already rich, you have to try hard not to keep getting a lot richer,"" Oxfam notes.","[In, lifetime, trillionaire, And, likely, trillionaire, Microsoft, founder, Bill, Gates, That, according, research, Oxfam, international, network, organization, collectively, working, alleviate, global, poverty, Its, recently, published, report, make, poorest, half, world, population, The, report, find, given, exponential, growth, existing, wealth, world, trillionaire, year, Gates, When, Gates, left, Microsoft, net, according, Oxfam, By, wealth, increased, despite, commendable, attempt, give, away, Foundation, report, say, In, addition, charitable, work, Gates]",0.0

Merck's results were impacted by a stronger dollar, as well as the loss of market exclusivity on certain drugs.    Facebook — Facebook reported adjusted quarterly profit of $1.41 per share, 10 cents above estimates, while revenue also came in above forecasts. The social media giant continues to benefit from gaining traction in mobile use and video. Separately, Facebook was ordered to pay $500 million to video game publisher ZeniMax, which had accused Facebook of stealing its virtual reality technology.    Becton Dickinson — The medical supplies maker reported adjusted quarterly profit of $2.33 per share, 21 cents above estimates. Revenue also beat forecasts, and the company raised its full-year 2017 earnings outlook as well.      Cigna — The insurance company beat forecasts by 13 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.87 per share, with revenue also above forecasts. The company's 2017 earnings outlook does fall below consensus estimates, but Cigna said it is pleased with the positive momentum it's seeing for the year ahead.    Macy's — The retailer's shares are higher following a New York Post report that CEO Terry Lundgren is open to friendly buyout offers, hoping to avoid a board shakeup that activist investor Starboard Value is demanding.    Delphi Automotive — The auto parts maker reported adjusted quarterly profit of $1.83 per share, 23 cents above estimates, while revenue also exceeded forecasts. Delphi is benefiting from its increasing involvement in self-driving car technology.    Estee Lauder — The beauty products maker beat estimates by 5 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.22 per share, but revenue was below Street forecasts as well as its full-year 2017 outlook.    Abercrombie &amp; Fitch — Abercrombie promoted merchandising chief Fran Horowitz to chief executive officer. A team led by Executive Chairman Arthur Martinez had led the teen apparel retailer since the departure of Michael Jeffries in 2014.    Allstate — Allstate reported adjusted quarterly profit of $2.17 per share, well above estimates of $1.63, though the insurer's revenue was very slightly below Street forecasts. Allstate was helped by a decline in casualty losses.    MetLife — MetLife came in 6 cents shy of estimates with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.28 per share, and revenue also missed estimates. The insurance company's results were impacted by losses in its hedging program amid a rise in interest rates near the end of the year.    Edwards Lifesciences — Edwards beat estimates by 3 cents, reporting adjusted quarterly profit of 75 cents per share. The medical equipment maker also beat on the top line, and gave upbeat earnings guidance for the full year. Edwards is seeing significant growth for its heart valve replacement systems.    Tractor Supply — The company reported quarterly profit of 94 cents per share, 2 cents above estimates, with revenue also beating forecasts. The retailer of farming and ranching supplies gave a mixed outlook for the full year, although it is seeing positive momentum in same-store sales after a string of declines.    Shutterfly — Shutterfly fell 21 cents shy of estimates with quarterly earnings of $2.63, and the online photo service's revenue missed as well. The company also gave a weaker than expected outlook.    Mead Johnson Nutrition — Mead Johnson is in talks to be bought by British consumer goods maker Reckitt Benckiser for $16.7 billion, or $90 per share. Both companies have confirmed the discussions, and Reckitt said it would finance the proposed deal with cash and debt.    Deutsche Bank — Deutsche Bank reported a bigger-than-expected loss for the final quarter of 2016, with the German bank failing to match the strong rebound in bond trading posted by its rivals.    Nokia — Nokia posted better than expected profits for the fourth quarter. The maker of networking equipment was helped by cost cuts as well as the acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent.    Sony — Sony cut its full year profit outlook, following a $1 billion writedown for the company's movie business.    JPMorgan Chase — JPMorgan appointed business banking head Jennifer Piepszak as chief executive of its card services division.    Costco — The warehouse retailer reported a comparable store sales increase of 7 percent for January, beating consensus estimates of a 3.9 percent rise.    Symantec — Symantec earned an adjusted 32 cents per share for its latest quarter, 4 cents above estimates, though the antivirus software maker's revenue was slightly below forecasts.

Cohn, director of the White House National Economic Council, stressed that no decisions have been made on particular ways to overhaul taxes. Summers also criticized the administration's trade policies, saying the Mexican peso has dropped about 15 percent amid all of Trump's tough talk, which gives ""anybody thinking about locating in Mexico ... a 15 percent cost advantage.""

As of Thursday's close, Spiegel had made just over $2 billion only a week after the social media company went public. According to the company's prospectus, Spiegel owns 210,970,819 shares of Snap, valuing his stake at $3.586 billion at the time of the IPO. Snap priced its shares at $17. The value of his stake had shot up to $4.791 billion by Thursday's close. Spiegel also received an $800 million bonus for taking the company public.  Snap's first week of trading has not been the smoothest, however. After rising 44 percent and 10.6 percent in its first two days of trading, respectively, the stock dropped 12.3 percent and 9.8 percent in its next two days. Snap shares since IPO  Source: FactSet Several Wall Street analysts initiated coverage of the stock with a sell rating, while only a few initiated the stock with a neutral rating, citing valuation and growth concerns. ""I consider myself cautiously optimistic on the company; the stock is just overvalued,"" said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group. Wieser initiated Snap with a sell last week and a price target of $10, representing more than 50 percent downside potential.

ANF,Abercrombie & Fitch Company,1:Abercrombie & Fitch insists it's not a teen retailer as it struggles to shed its sexy reputation,"Thursday,  2 Mar 2017 |  2:07  PM ET","Abercrombie &amp; Fitch is trying to change the notion that it's all about scantily-clad teenagers. So far, those efforts are falling flat. Despite launching its largest-ever advertising campaign during the holiday season, comparable sales at the company's namesake label tumbled 13 percent in the fourth quarter. That followed a 14 percent drop in the prior three-month period, pouring water on the promise that trends would improve in the second half. Now, with the company once again speaking to a second-half inflection, it will need to do a better job articulating the changes afoot at its namesake brand — and hope that customers like what they see. ""They missed on [nearly] every metric,"" Stacey Widlitz, president of SW Retail Advisors, said of the company's fourth-quarter earnings results. ""I don't think things have gotten much better."" Under pressure from the growth of fast-fashion, off-price and online retailers, Abercrombie has been trying to reverse its sales declines by reinventing its brand. While in the past it was known for risqué marketing and the idea that teens had to dress a certain way to be cool, its new look preaches inclusivity and individuality. A similar type of ""be yourself"" messaging has contributed to the rampant success of American Eagle's Aerie label, which bans the use of airbrushing on models. To introduce its new position, Abercrombie in October ran an advertising campaign that challenged the idea that people had its brand figured out. The ad then showed a series of young people smiling while wearing its clothes. ""Not only is the message confusing and opaque, but the promise of change that it suggests is not entirely delivered on by stores, which look and feel the same,"" Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, told investors. Fran Horowitz, who filled the company's long-vacant CEO role in February, admitted the brand could have been sharper in communicating its new identity. To fix that, the company in January named a new chief marketing officer, who will be charged with ""enhancing the power and clarity"" of its brand. Yet even if it succeeds in doing so, it will be tough for Abercrombie to turn the tide. Whereas the company's California-centric Hollister brand has made some strides, it didn't start off with the same polarizing reputation. What's more, Abercrombie is now trying to attract an older customer. Executive Chairman Arthur Martinez underscored the brand's traction with twentysomethings on the company's conference call, saying more than 80 percent of its U.S. sales come from people over age 18. Yet while that customer may be an easier sell than fickle, cash-strapped teens, it's still a tough demographic to nail down, Widlitz said. That's particularly true as the company moves farther away from putting small logos on its products, likely in response to consumers' distaste for oversize branding. The last time Abercrombie took this approach, sales ""fell off a cliff,"" Widlitz said. ""Is the consumer at any age willing to pay $60… for a sweater that you can't identify, when you can get it anywhere else for a third of the price? I think the answer is no,"" she said. Abercrombie on Thursday reported revenue and earnings that fell short of Wall Street's expectations, while same-store sales came in a hair better than anticipated. The stock rose more than 15 percent in afternoon trading, a move analysts attributed to a slightly better than anticipated first-quarter outlook and short sellers covering their positions. Short sellers borrow shares of a stock and repurchase them later when the price drops. The goal is to profit on the price difference. Abercrombie shares have lost more than half their value over the past year. They were last trading hands at $13.41.","[Abercrombie, amp, Fitch, trying, change, notion, scantily, clad, teenager, So, far, effort, falling, flat, Despite, launching, largest, advertising, campaign, comparable, Abercrombie, amp, Fitch, trying, change, notion, scantily, clad, teenager, So, far, effort, falling, flat, Despite, launching, largest, advertising, campaign, comparable, company, namesake, Widlitz, president, SW, Retail, Advisors, said, company, earnings, result, I, think, thing, gotten, better, Under, pressure, growth, fashion, online, retailer, Abercrombie, trying, reverse, decline, reinventing, While, past, known, risqu, marketing, idea, teen, dress, certain, look, preaches, inclusivity, individuality, A, similar, online, retailer, Abercrombie, trying, reverse, decline, reinventing, While, past, known, risqu, marketing, idea, teen, dress, certain, look, preaches, ...]",1.0

""Target is resetting itself, rethinking itself and needs to reposition its best assets."" Today consumers are placing more value on convenience and the ease of shopping, Chen told CNBC on Tuesday, as big players like Amazon have come into the industry and changed the pace of the game for everyone. Wal-Mart, for example, has made some major changes to its operations as of late, taking aim at Target with new technology.  ""Setback is a setup for a comeback"" when it comes to Target, Chen said. The big-box retailer is putting up money to invest in areas where the company knows it must be reinvented, he said. Target reported sales and earnings Tuesday that missed Wall Street's expectations, and the stock sank more than 13 percent in early trading, putting it on pace for its worst day since Aug. 31, 1998. Target's gross margin was impacted during the fourth quarter due to elevated markdowns and an increase in digital sales, the company said in its press release. The Minneapolis-based retailer said it plans to continue to invest in lower gross margins in the coming quarters, to ensure its prices remain competitive. ""[Target] is taking margins down, but are they going low enough?"" UBS analyst Michael Lasser asked during the ""Power Lunch"" interview. ""We don't know."" To please investors, Target should be aiming to drive sustainable sales and earnings growth, Lasser said. Overall, Target remains a ""well-loved brand,"" especially by key demographics of shoppers, Chen added, and the retailer is ""facing the music"" of the retail revolution that exists today. ""This is really a test … of how they manage setback."" — CNBC's Krystina Gustafson contributed to this report.","[We, witnessing, seismic, shift, retail, Cowen, amp, Co, retail, analyst, Oliver, Chen, said, interview, CNBC, Power, Lunch, Target, resetting, rethinking, need, reposition, asset, Today, consumer, placing, value, We, witnessing, seismic, shift, retail, Cowen, amp, Co, retail, analyst, Oliver, Chen, said, interview, CNBC, Power, Lunch, Target, resetting, rethinking, need, reposition, asset, Today, consumer, placing, value, convenience, ease, shopping, Chen, told, CNBC, Tuesday, big, player, like, told, CNBC, Tuesday, big, player, like, Amazon, come, industry, changed, game, Wal, Mart, example, made, change, operation, late, taking, aim, Target, technology, Setback, setup, comeback, come, Target, Chen, said, The, big, retailer, putting, invest, area, company, ...]",1.0

FSLR,"First Solar, Inc.",3:Cramer: Don't take Trump literally when it comes to stock picking,"Friday, 20 Jan 2017 |  6:13  PM ET","  Jim Cramer says America just swore in its first pure business president, Donald Trump—and it now marks a brave new world for investors.    ""We have been living with Trump's presidency in waiting for nearly three months and I can't think of a previous elected official who has given you more of a pro-growth game plan than Donald J. Trump,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.    While the possibility of a wave of post-inaugural selling of Trump-related stocks did cross Cramer's mind, he quickly realized that it likely won't happen. If Trump is true to his word, then investors could miss out on the potential gains.  Therefore, ringing the register here could be a mistake, he said.    ""You shouldn't take the President too literally when it comes to stock picking,"" Cramer said.   Since the passage of NAFTA, it has become almost ritual to fire American workers and buy non-American. Unless it becomes too impractical or too expensive to make goods overseas, Cramer found only a small amount of manufacturing companies that fit the ""buy American, hire American"" bill.    Businesses have moved jobs offshore to boost earnings, and those jobs are likely not coming back, Cramer said. The companies that ignored globalization were in fact gobbled up by more aggressive competitors, who then closed factories in the U.S. and moved them overseas.    Thus, the stocks that investors bought on Friday were the ones that fit into the narrow scope of Trump, like concrete, wood, plastics, agriculture and defense.  They also bought American service providers, like housing. However, if business accelerates because of Trump's policies, which means interest rates will go up. That will trigger housing and materials to do poorly because it is more expensive to get a mortgage.    If someone asked Cramer what industry President Barack Obama  favored the most, he would say solar power. Meanwhile, the worst performer in the S&amp;P 500 Index during Obama's tenure was First Solar, down 76 percent.    ""Let's not get too narrowly focused on Trump's agenda,"" Cramer said.    Moving forward, Cramer will be focused on the biggest stock winners from Trump's trifecta of lower corporate taxes, deregulation and the repatriation of overseas funds. This will take time to pass though, which is why Cramer expects to see a honeymoon phase—and then transition into punishment.    ""You should buy stocks into any non-earnings related sell-off and be glad you didn't panic out today because it turns out there was nothing to panic over,"" Cramer said.    Questions for Cramer?

Citi is selling mortgage servicing rights on approximately 780,000 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans to New Residential Mortgage, subject to regulatory approval.   Tempur Sealy — The mattress maker has terminated its supply contracts with mattress retailer Mattress Firm. Tempur Sealy said the two sides were unable to come to an agreement after Mattress Firm asked for significant economic concessions.   Walt Disney — The stock was upgraded to ""overweight"" from ""equal-weight"" at Morgan Stanley, which also raised the price target to $124 per share from $101. Morgan Stanley thinks ESPN has the potential to accelerate revenue growth against a more aggressively managed cost base.   American Express — Keefe, Bruyette, &amp; Woods upgraded the stock to ""outperform"" from ""market perform,"" citing improved fundamentals. KBW said risks remain from a competitive environment, but with lessening impact.   Ixia — Electronic testing equipment maker Keysight Technologies is buying the provider of security solutions for $1.6 billion in cash, or $19.65 per share. Ixia stock had been boosted by reports beginning in early December that it was considering strategic alternatives.   Lowe's — The home improvement retailer announced a new $5 billion repurchase program. The new program will be added to a prior program's balance, which stood at $627 million as of October 28, 2016.   Delta Air Lines — Delta is returning to normal operation after computer problems led to widespread disruptions over the weekend.   Toyota — Toyota saw its four-year streak of leading the world in vehicle sales end in 2016. Newly announced figures by the Japanese automaker show that it came in second to Volkswagen, with sales of 10.18 million vehicles compared to 10.3 million for Volkswagen.   Starbucks — CEO Howard Schultz said the coffee chain would hire 10,000 refugees in 75 countries over the next five years. The move came after President Trump's executive order placing restrictions on travelers from seven countries.   Anthem — Anthem shares are undervalued and could rise by 30 percent, according to a Barron's article. The paper said the health insurer has the most room for profit margin and earnings improvement in the industry, and also has the lowest price to earnings ratio.   Sony — Sony will take a $976 million charge against earnings for its movie business. That comes as Sony cuts the profit outlook for DVDs and other home entertainment areas.   CSX — The railroad operator is in settlement talks with ex-Canadian Pacific CEO Hunter Harrison and activist investment firm Mantle Ridge, according to The Wall Street Journal. The talks could make Harrison the CEO of the rail operator.   Fitbit — The maker of wearable fitness devices will announce job cuts of 5 to 10 percent of its workforce today, according to a report in The Information. That would come amid an announcement that fourth-quarter results were below expectations. Fitbit currently has a workforce of about 1,600.   Fiat Chrysler — The automaker plans to add as many as 400 new U.S. dealerships, according a story in Automotive News. Fiat Chrysler currently has about 2,500 U.S. dealerships.","[focus, mortgage, origination, Citi, selling, mortgage, servicing, right, approximately, Fannie, Mae, Freddie, Mac, loan, New, Residential, Mortgage, subject, regulatory, approval, Tempur, Sealy, The, mattress, maker, terminated, supply, contract, mattress, retailer, Mattress, Firm, Tempur, Sealy, said, unable, come, agreement, Mattress, Firm, mortgage, origination, Citi, selling, mortgage, servicing, right, approximately, Fannie, Mae, Freddie, Mac, loan, New, Residential, Mortgage, subject, regulatory, approval, Tempur, Sealy, The, mattress, maker, terminated, supply, contract, mattress, retailer, Mattress, Firm, Tempur, Sealy, said, unable, come, agreement, Mattress, Firm, asked, Mac, loan, New, Residential, Mortgage, subject, regulatory, approval, Tempur, Sealy, The, mattress, maker, terminated, supply, contract, mattress, retailer, Mattress, Firm, ...]",1.0

FB,"Facebook, Inc.",34:Why Snap's unusual headquarters could make the stock risky for investors,"Wednesday, 22 Feb 2017 | 10:26  AM ET","Snap's headquarters are unlike those of any other company. It's a handful of low-slung buildings scattered across the expensive real estate landscape of Venice, California. The main office is a stone's throw from Venice's famous boardwalk, teeming with tourists and joggers, and just a bit further from the surf. The offices make up more than 300,000 square feet across buildings on at least six different streets in Venice. Snap employees pick up breakfast at the cafeteria in one building and then walk across the street to their desks. Many of the buildings are shaded between Venice's famous colonnades, and they're interspersed with some of the hippest coffee shops and restaurants in Los Angeles. The lack of one main headquarters office is unusual enough that the company listed it as a risk in its S-1. ...This diffuse structure may prevent us from fostering positive employee morale and encouraging social interaction among our employees and different business units. Moreover, because our office buildings are dispersed throughout the area, we may be unable to adequately oversee employees and business functions... This spread-out format could not be more different from the typical Silicon Valley office park or San Francisco high-rise. Headquarters like Facebook's Menlo Park campus or Google's in Mountain View are designed to give employees everything they need so they stay put. From gyms and sushi bars, to dry cleaning (even a dentist at Facebook) there's no reason to venture outside, which would mean not only stopping work, but giving up an opportunity to collaborate and brainstorm with colleagues. We don't have any recent footage from inside Snap's offices because the company is notoriously secretive. It's pulled the logos off some of its doors and has a number of security guards outside its buildings, and no windows to peek in. While being so close to the beach certainly has its appeal — and there's lower competition for talent — it also has its drawbacks. The company cites Venice as ""an enticing location to live,"" but warns in its S-1 of ""certain disadvantages such as the increased need to recruit remotely and requiring employees to relocate to Venice, California or the Los Angeles area."" While employees may want to live in Venice, housing is expensive. According to Trulia the median sales price in the area increased 14% in the past year. The price per square foot is just a hair less than Palo Alto and more than 25% higher than in San Francisco. And with real estate inventory tight, that may make it difficult for Snap to find other nearby real estate to expand.","[area, unable, adequately, oversee, employee, business, function, This, spread, format, different, typical, Silicon, Valley, office, San, Francisco, rise, Headquarters, like, Facebook, Menlo, Park, campus, Google, Mountain, View, designed, give, employee, need, stay, put, From, gym, sushi, bar, dry, cleaning, dentist, Facebook, Menlo, Park, campus, Google, Mountain, View, designed, give, employee, need, stay, put, From, gym, sushi, bar, dry, cleaning, dentist, Facebook, reason, venture, outside, mean, stopping, work, giving, opportunity, collaborate, brainstorm, colleague, We, recent, footage, inside, Snap, office, company, notoriously]",0.0

The Dow Jones industrial average fell about 100 points, with Caterpillar contributing the most losses. Caterpillar's stock declined more than 4 percent after law enforcement officials searched their offices. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities, said he is not worried about this decline. ""I'd be much more concerned if, after being up 300 points yesterday, we were up 100 points today."" The S&amp;P 500 declined 0.6 percent, with financials declining more than 1 percent. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.7 percent. ""It's only normal. We're at record levels and at some point, it's natural to see some profit taking,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. Snap — the parent company for social media platform Snapchat — saw its stock risemore than 40 percent, pushing it well above the $17 a share it priced its IPO. Investors eagerly awaited the IPO as they looked for clues on the health of the technology IPO market. ""Given all the negatives associated with this company, it's going to be one of the more interesting stories we'll see in the next few days,"" said Maris Ogg, president at Tower Bridge Advisors. Snap entered public market a day after the three major U.S. stock indexes posted their best session of the year on the back of President Donald Trump's speech to Congress. ""This still is not the major optimism we need for a top,"" said Chuck Self, chief investment officer at iSectors. ""But ... I think there aren't too many more feel-good speeches the president can give without specifics."" Also rising have been expectations for a Federal Reserve rate hike this month, amid a combination of strong economic data and hawkish rhetoric from several key officials. Most recently, Fed Governor Lael Brainard — a known dove in the central bank's monetary policy committee — said Wednesday evening the Fed could raise rates ""soon,"" citing an improved global economy. ""We are closing in on full employment, inflation is moving gradually toward our target, foreign growth is on more solid footing, and risks to the outlook are as close to balanced as they have been in some time,"" Brainard said. Fed Governor Jerome Powell said Thursday that ""the case for a rate increase for March has come together."" Market expectations for a March rate hike were around 80 percent, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. ""The Fed finally is on board that the economy is fine, ... and that's a positive for Wall Street,"" said Tower Bridge's Ogg. In economic news,  initial U.S. jobless claims totaled 223,000, well below the expected 243,000. Last week's reading increased 6,000 to 244,000. ""The overall trend in employment continues to be pretty positive,"" said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. ""The real question is whether that will drive more people into the labor market."" U.S. Treasury yields rose, with the two-year note yield hitting a fresh 2009 high, while the 10-year note yield reached its highest level since Feb. 16. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 112.58 points, or 0.53 percent, to close at 21,002.97, with Caterpillar leading decliners and Home Depot the top advancer. The S&amp;P 500 dropped 14.04 points, or 0.59 percent, to end at 2,381.92, with financials leading nine sectors lower and utilities and telecommunications the only risers. The Nasdaq composite declined 42.81 points, or 0.73 percent, to close at 5,861.22.

LMT,Lockheed Martin Corporation,17:Lockheed 'very close to a deal' on latest F-35 contract with Trump administration,"Tuesday, 24 Jan 2017 |  1:42  PM ET","  Lockheed Martin is ""very close to a deal"" with the government for the 10th delivery lot of its F-35 stealth fighter, an aircraft that President Donald Trump has publicly criticized  as being too expensive.    CEO Marillyn Hewson spoke about the pending deal on the defense contractor's fourth-quarter earnings call Tuesday, calling conversations she's had with the president ""very productive.""    ""President Trump recognizes that the F-35 is a very large program — the largest program in the Department of Defense,"" Hewson said. ""He wants to make the sure that the American taxpayer is getting the lowest possible cost on the program.""    Hewson maintained that these cost reductions would not be about ""slashing our profit"" or hurting the company's margins. Instead, she reiterated that Lockheed has been bringing down the cost of the F-35 aircraft, and is moving forward with a ""sustainment cost reduction"" that will reduce costs in the supply chain and manufacturing.  Moreover, the company is working to take costs out of the materials used as the F-35 program moves along.    ""I've also had the opportunity to share with him [Trump] things that the Department of Defense can do and how they might buy the aircraft differently in the future that might help continue to drive the costs down,"" Hewson said. ""He welcomed that discussion.""    Still, the company's shares were down some 2 percent in early afternoon trading, after the company issued 2017 guidance that fell short of Wall Street consensus estimates. That shortfall was the result of pension impacts.    The 10th lot of the F-35 aircraft represents a total of 90 planes. Lockheed projects the F-35A aircraft's current per-unit cost of about $100 million will fall to $85 million by the time it reaches the 13th lot of the so-called low-rate initial production. The current production of the aircraft is in lot 10.   Hewson referred to the F-35 program as ""a growth engine"" for Lockheed, saying, ""We continue to see growing international demand for it.""    ""It's not just the program of record that we have with the U.S. government on the services that are buying the aircraft and the international partners that are already signed up, but many other countries are showing interest in the program,"" she said.    There's still a possibility Lockheed could see some impact if the Pentagon buys more of Boeing's F-18 fighter jets, as the president has suggested. Trump has expressed interest in the older F-18 fighter because of its lower cost, although the Boeing-produced plane doesn't have all the high-tech stealth capabilities of the fifth-generation F-35 planes.

URI,"United Rentals, Inc.",5:Cramer Remix: Two companies spending to dominate the world,"Friday, 27 Jan 2017 |  7:26  PM ET","  Regardless of what President Donald Trump does next, Jim Cramer says earnings are still running the show on Wall Street.    ""The best chances to make money come when the initial negativity brings stocks down and then upon closer inspection people realize that those stocks shouldn't be down at all. Look for those situations,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.    With Facebook's stock also on a run recently, Cramer is nervous because Alphabet reported a strong quarter, but got hit anyways. He expects Facebook to say it needs to spend a lot of money on video, which could hurt the stock.    ""Think bigger on both Facebook and Alphabet because these companies are doing everything they can to dominate the world, so you can't worry about a given quarter's spending as long as it has a clear path for a payoff,"" Cramer said.   In just three short years, Carnival CEO Arnold Donald has transformed the company's image from a struggling cruise line operator into a personalized experience, especially for millennials.    This year's Cruise Travel Report revealed that a growing number of millennials and Generation Y travelers are embracing cruises as a method of travel. Cruise travel has now become the most popular travel preference for younger generations.    Millennials are also known for taking selfies, and Donald was ready to take advantage of that.    ""How we capitalize on it is our product is just engineered for it,"" Donald said.    Marriott Vacations Worldwide, a company that specializes in time shares, has also made a comeback. The stock has come roaring back after a multi-month downturn. From its highs in July 2015 to its lows in February 2016, the stock was cut in half.    Since that time, the stock has soared 86 percent from February of last year. And if the economy gets a boost this year, it could be even more attractive. Cramer found the company to be too well run and the business model to be too attractive for the stock to be ignored.    ""I recommend buying part of your position before the company reports next month, and then using any post-earnings weakness to buy some more,"" Cramer said.    United Rentals' stock roared more than 11 percent on Thursday after reporting a very strong quarter. This was just one more upward move, as the stock has now more than tripled in the past 11 months.    Cramer dug in to find out how it accomplished this big move, and if investors just getting in now have already missed it.    Ultimately Cramer found that the stock is just in the early innings of its comeback, and said it is not too late to buy what he regards as a surprisingly inexpensive stock.    ""I know we are not early, but I know that this stock will be bought on any dip and you want to be in there buying, too,"" Cramer said.    In a raging debate from his fans on Twitter, many people have asked Jim Cramer if he is for or against President Donald Trump.    The truth is that he is neither. Cramer cares about the stock market, not politics.    ""My agenda? It has always been the same: higher stock prices. That is my true north; because most of you home gamers own stocks and I want you to make money. It's that simple,"" Cramer said.    That's why when Cramer sees Trump's agenda of deregulation, lower corporate taxes and repatriation of foreign assets, he likes it. He thinks it could lead to higher stock prices.    Ultimately, the issue of building a wall has raised political risk, Cramer said. It has introduced real uncertainty in to stocks, and Trump's agenda has become shaky. It must go away, but Cramer isn't sure how it will, given that Trump campaigned on it and he isn't likely to give up his campaign promises.    ""It makes more concerned and it should concern you, too, if it isn't resolved in a civil and lasting fashion,"" Cramer said.    In the Lightning Round, Cramer gave his take on a few stocks from callers:    Allergan: ""Allergan is the only stock that the actionalertsplus.com club owns. The reason is is because I think that Brent Saunders [CEO] is going to turn it around and it's a very low multiple. I say you can own AGN, but it's the only one.""    Asbury Automotive Group: ""I think the stock can rebound. Maybe it rebounds when AutoNation reports, gives you a better number. I have to tell you in the auto parts business I like AAP. I know that it's not a car retailer but Advanced Auto Parts I think is a terrific situation.""

HUM,Humana Inc.,6:Humana's exit from 2018 Obamacare market sets states and insurers scrambling,"Wednesday, 15 Feb 2017 |  3:17  PM ET","Humana's decision to exit the Obamacare exchange market in 2018 is setting off alarm bells for health insurers and regulators, even as the Trump administration issues new rules to try to stabilize the exchanges. ""I think you will see a lot more withdrawals,"" said Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini, at a Wall Street Journal health care event, one day after Aetna and Humana agreed mutually to end their merger agreement. ""There isn't enough money in the ACA as it's structured, even with its fees and taxes, to support the population that needs to be served,"" he explained, adding that without government funding, similar to Medicare, to help insurers with the costs of covering patients with high medical bills, the exchange market will not work. ""It is in a death spiral."" Separately, the health department released Wednesday a set of rules for 2018 that, among other things, tightened enrollment rules in an effort to prevent people from signing up for coverage and then dropping it after incurring high medical bills. ""I think we should be encouraged by the signal that the administration wants to stabilize the market,"" said Andy Slavitt, the former director of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid under the Obama administration, but he thinks insurers need much more clarity on bigger issues. ""Right now, the greatest uncertainty is whether or not the individual mandate, which is the principal driver to help keep costs lower, is going to be enforced,"" he explained. ""Within the next month, insurers have to start submitting rates and deciding where they're going to participate. It's very hard to do that if you don't know the rules of the road. It's very hard to do that if you don't know how your competitors are interpreting the rules of the road."" Humana's decision to pull out of the individual market is hitting hard in Tennessee, where the firm is currently the only insurer offering coverage in three of the state's largest metropolitan communities, including Knoxville. State health insurance officials are already scrambling to deal with the fallout. ""We are looking to continue conversations with Humana about our specific unique circumstances… having no option for those 40,000 Tennesseans if they withdraw from the Knoxville area,"" said Julie Mix McPeak, the state's insurance commissioner, ""but also trying to talk to other insurers… to see if they might be willing to expand coverage to make sure we don't have uncovered areas."" Two weeks ago, McPeak testified at a congressional hearing on health reform, and she urged Congress and the administration to act quickly to address the uncertainty weighing on the individual insurance market because insurers face a federal deadline to submit rates for next year by the beginning of May. McPeak said the stakes are even higher, after Humana's exit from her state. ""We are in such a compressed time schedule for 2018,"" she said. ""Either we need to relax the time requirements put on us by HHS, or we need to provide additional certainty to the marketplace because we're really running out of time."" On Wednesday, federal health officials said they intend to release a revised proposed timeline for Obamacare plan rates to be certified. That move would give insurers more time to implement changes that officials are proposing for rules about Obamacare plans.","[Humana, decision, exit, Obamacare, exchange, market, setting, alarm, bell, health, insurer, regulator, Trump, administration, issue, rule, try, stabilize, exchange, I, Humana, decision, exit, Obamacare, exchange, market, setting, alarm, bell, health, insurer, regulator, Trump, administration, issue, rule, try, stabilize, exchange, I, think, lot, withdrawal, said, Aetna, CEO, Mark, Bertolini, Wall, Street, Journal, health, care, event, Aetna, Humana, agreed, mutually, end, rule, try, stabilize, exchange, I, think, lot, withdrawal, said, Aetna, CEO, Mark, Bertolini, Wall, Street, Journal, health, care, event, Aetna, Humana, agreed, mutually, end, merger, agreement, There, ACA, structured, fee, tax, support, population, need, served, explained, adding, government, funding, similar, spiral, ...]",1.0
SWK,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.","1:Sears loss narrows in the fourth quarter, but revenues continue to erode","Thursday,  9 Mar 2017 |  8:51  AM ET","Sears on Thursday reported a narrower loss in the fiscal fourth quarter than the period a year earlier, but revenues continued to tumble amid a wave of store closures and declines at its remaining stores. The company's long-term debt obligations nearly doubled from the prior year, despite the chain's efforts to raise cash by selling off assets. Amid its ongoing struggles, the retailer took a $381 million charge during the quarter to write down the value of its trade name — highlighting the declining worth of the Sears brand. Shares of Sears, which have lost nearly 60 percent of their value over the past year, were more than 11 percent higher in premarket trading. Sears lost an adjusted $1.28 per share during the fiscal fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $1.70 a year earlier, as it benefited from lower payroll, inventory and marketing costs. That figure excluded items including the writedown of its name. On a net basis, the chain lost $5.67 per diluted share. Revenue, however, continued to slide. Sears rang up $6.05 billion in sales during the holiday period, down 17 percent from $7.3 billion a year earlier.  That decline was mostly attributable to the company's dwindling store fleet, though sales also slid at its remaining shops. Comparable revenues were down 10.3 percent, driven by an 8 percent drop at Kmart and a 12.3 percent decline at Sears.  ""While the challenging holiday selling season pressured margins and comparable store sales, we were able to successfully improve profitability through disciplined inventory and costs management,"" Chief Financial Officer Jason Hollar said in a statement. ""We will continue to take actions to drive profitability, generate liquidity and adjust our overall capital structure while continuing to meet all of our financial obligations."" Indeed, Sears has made many maneuvers to bring itself back to profitability. In February, the chain said it would close 150 stores and reorganize the business to save $1 billion annually. And on Thursday, it completed the sale of its Craftsman brand to Stanley Black &amp; Decker for an initial upfront cash payment of $525 million with additional payments over time. Sears plans to use some of the proceeds from these transactions, as well as anticipated improvements in its profitability and working capital, to reduce its overall debt and pension obligations by at least $1.5 billion this fiscal year. The company's pension plan has been a significant source of cash burn over the past 12 years, with Sears paying out nearly $4 billion to it over that time. In January, the company said it had taken steps to shore up its liquidity by up to $1 billion. That injection is tied to a $500 million real-estate-backed loan, and a secured standby letter of credit facility worth up to $500 million. That letter of credit, from affiliates of CEO Eddie Lampert's hedge fund, ESL Investments, was announced in December. At the end of the fourth quarter, Sears had $286 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared with $238 million a year earlier. It had no short-term borrowings. However, the company's total long-term debt, including capital lease obligations, was $4.2 billion. That compares with $2.2 billion a year earlier.

STZ,STZ,2:Cramer’s survival guide to riding the Trump rally for the rest of the week,"Tuesday, 17 Jan 2017 |  6:13  PM ET","  If you are an investor looking to ride the Trump rally for the rest of the week, Jim Cramer says to make sure you muster up a strong level of conviction.    ""We are at a moment where there are so many cross-currents, some of which are caused by the president-elect himself, that you will need a cast-iron stomach to run the gauntlet from here through Friday's inauguration,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.    The reason it is so important to have firm belief in stocks in a portfolio right now, Cramer said, is because a ""tweet lightning bolt"" from Donald Trump could take down a company's shares at any time.   Commentary from Trump sent beer and alcohol distributor Constellation Brands soaring on Tuesday. Constellation is the sole U.S. distributor of Mexican beers Modelo and Corona. Shares have been hit hard recently over fears of a cross-border tax to import goods made overseas.    However when reports surfaced that the president-elect confirmed that the Congressional plan to implement the tax was too complicated, Constellation rallied $4 a share. Retailers like PVH, which makes Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein overseas, skyrocketed 6 percent on the news.    Worries then surfaced that if the president-elect disagrees with his own party on this issue, it could derail the pro-business tripod of lower corporate taxes, repatriation of foreign profits and deregulation. If that is the case, it could mean the economy won't be as strong as many expect.    Cramer wasn't worried.    ""The president-elect can't help saying these things. He likes a deal. He puts out points and then he negotiates. It's very hard to believe that he won't get his way eventually and I think that interest rates will keep going higher here,"" Cramer said.    The sell-off in bank stocks on Tuesday made them more attractive to Cramer, not less. He recommended waiting two days before buying any stocks going into the dip.    Oil stocks are also hard to own right now with crude stalled in the low $50s. Nevertheless, Cramer encouraged investors to stay long oil and gas.     ""Come Friday, we will have the most pro-fossil fuel president in history. Don't be whipsawed … find something you like that is oil and gas and stick with it,"" Cramer said.    Ultimately, it won't be the end of the world if Trump makes a comment that is at odds with Congress, Cramer said. His pro-business platform will remain intact. That's why Cramer said to use any weakness to buy stocks that you believe in, especially in the oil and gas space.    Questions for Cramer?

M,Macy's Inc,20:Cramer Remix: Why I do not fear a Trump-inspired market correction,"Monday,  6 Feb 2017 |  7:07  PM ET","  When it comes to President Donald Trump's agenda to deregulate banks, Jim Cramer says investors are fixated on that everything has to go through Congress. ""That is the conventional wisdom, and it is just plain wrong,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. The president has freedom when it comes to how hard he wants to enforce rules, and Cramer interprets Trump's actions so far as signaling that he wants regulators to have a lighter touch. In the past, regulators have used the Dodd-Frank Act to come down hard on banks. Those days are over. So, while many investors think a big, bad Trump-related correction in the stock market is coming, Cramer said to count him out. Trump's recent executive orders will slow the economic agenda of corporate tax reform and maybe repatriation of foreign assets, but Cramer thinks a big correction is less likely than others have suggested. The repercussions of the dramatic decline in department stores have reverberated deeply into the retail sector, and Cramer says this cannot be dismissed as a one-time-only incident. ""The implications here are horrendous for a host of different companies,"" Cramer said. Perfume and make-up have stood strong as the best segments for stores like Macy's. When Cramer listened to the conference call for Estee Lauder, he realized the struggles of the department store have cut into the company's growth. The conference call made Cramer want to recommend Ulta Beauty, which was cited by Estee Lauder as one of its best venues. However, he couldn't ignore that department stores were mentioned repeatedly as a source of weakness for Estee Lauder. North Face is a department-store brand that Cramer attributed as the chief reason for VF Corp's tumble. PVH has been hurt from Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein's holiday sales, while Newell Brands cited declining mall traffic as the reason for moderate sales growth. Hasbro seemed to be the only company that could fight the trend, as shares skyrocketed 14 percent on Monday, the company's CEO Brian Goldner explained that the success could be seen right in the brand blueprint. ""It's all about engaging the consumer across storytelling and innovation, a lot of digital engagement. We do it all around the world,"" Goldner said. ""Our international business, category for category and region for region, we are up considerably."" Hasbro has the exclusive rights to make toys, games and action figures, thanks to a valuable partnership with Disney. It covers well-known franchises movies such as ""Star Wars"", ""Frozen"" and the older brands such as Nerf and My Little Pony. Another stock with a remarkable comeback that landed on Cramer's radar was Advanced Micro Devices, up 10 percent on Monday. This seemed almost impossible to Cramer not too long ago, and it seems that no one saw it coming. AMD is a global semiconductor company that makes processers and graphic chips. After years of small performance, the stock came roaring back in 2016, more than doubling from the $2.87 per share stock price it started the year off with. Since then, it has continued to climb. Cramer attributed the turnaround to the mastermind, CEO Lisa Su. The company pivoted away from PCs and into faster-growing segments like data centers and virtual reality, while becoming more competitive with Nvidia in the gaming space. This allowed the company to turn around its numbers. Given the stock's strong run, Cramer recommended waiting for a pullback before buying. ""This comeback is far from over as the company expands into new end markets and puts up a better fight versus Intel and Nvidia,"" Cramer said. The airline group has been flying high since the election, but last week it was slammed hard, as investors worried that airport protests in response to Trump's new immigration rules could impact air travel. One of the only airlines that barely budged was Alaska Air Group, which has climbed to $95 from $72 in just under three months. Approximately 10 months ago, Alaska Air announced it would acquire Richard Branson's U.S. airline, Virgin America, for about $4 billion. The idea was that Virgin would give Alaska Air's West Coast network inroads to the East Coast, while also creating cost cuts. ""The airlines are in terrific shape here, and if you like domestic growth, Alaska Air may be the best of the bunch,"" Cramer said. He recommended waiting for it to report on Wednesday, and then wait for the stock to come down to get a better price. In the Lightning Round, Cramer gave his take on a few stocks from callers: AK Steel Holding: ""AK Steel, not my favorite. I like Nucor because I love a good balance sheet. I know steel's letter X is hot. I just want to stick with the one that has been so good for so long, which is Nucor."" Exelixis, Inc: ""We liked it much, much lower. It's got a great speculative book of business, but remember it is speculative. That is really important I don't want anyone to confuse this with Merck.""

JPM,JPM,"11:Cramer: Tectonic shift in the market means buy, not sell, on a rate hike","Tuesday, 14 Feb 2017 |  6:12  PM ET","In Jim Cramer's perspective, there is no denying that the market has undergone a tectonic shift. The market is doing better because business is better, both in the U.S. and overseas. Stocks now have different catalysts than they used to, which means investors need to react differently if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. Instead of dumping stocks on a rate hike, Cramer said to buy them. ""Business has momentum. This market is saying that momentum will not be broken up by three rate hikes, nor by the president, nor Congress. It is a rising tide that is lifting almost all of the boats, except those that did best under Obama,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. There are new rules to follow now, Cramer said. He outlined everything that investors must unlearn, so that the market can continue to power higher. In the past decade, any time Fed Chair Janet Yellen spoke about raising interest rates, the market would plummet. Those days are now over, Cramer said. It is time to recognize that if the Fed tightens while business is doing better, it will not be a disastrous move, but instead be the validation that the market craves. Cramer also reminded investors that President Donald Trump is a pro-business president. While the stock market did rally under Obama, it was a different set of stocks. Now, it a completely different group stands to benefit, as stocks like Bank of America and JPMorgan continue to push higher. Bank stocks seem very cheap to Cramer versus the rest of the market. ""They are only going to get cheaper if Trump's deregulation allows them to return capital at their own pace and not the pace of the government,"" Cramer said. The third rule to unlearn is that even though many investors think that stocks are undervalued, that doesn't mean it is the truth. When Cramer looked around the world, he saw that other markets are doing far better than the U.S. That is because their economies were even worse than the U.S. was to begin with. So, these three new stock market rules mean that it is time for investors to throw away their old playbook and get ready for a rate hike. Rates must go higher because there is more demand for money, which means banks will do well. And a president who is pro-business could ultimately mean good things for business, too, even if his approach is a bit unorthodox. Questions for Cramer?

CXO,Concho Resources Inc.,"2:Oil stocks are lagging, but analysts see a path to growth for some drillers","Thursday, 23 Feb 2017 |  4:43  PM ET","Energy stocks have been lagging the S&amp;P 500, but some analysts see a path to growth for some well-positioned U.S. drillers. The energy sector managed to rally about half a percent on Thursday, but it's still down about 6 percent this year. Meanwhile the S&amp;P 500 has gained about 5.5 percent this year. For some, the disparity comes down to the belief that oil prices will remain stuck in a narrow range as OPEC continues to cut output and U.S. drillers increase production. That will cap the recovery for oil stocks. But some independent exploration and production companies stand to reap bigger gains from the oil price recovery than integrated oil companies like Chevron and ExxonMobil and larger independents, said Timothy Rezvan, managing director of energy research at Mizuho Americas. The bigger players are less nimble and have committed to big shareholder payouts, he explained. ""The companies that are being rewarded here are the companies that have clear growth blueprints"" and access to the infrastructure, services and materials necessary to economically drill wells and deliver oil and gas to markets. That includes companies that were early movers in core oil producing regions, like the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico, where the cost of producing a barrel of oil is relatively low. New entrants to the Permian face challenges as the region grows crowded, Rezvan said. Some of the drillers Mizuho has buy ratings on established Permian players Diamondback Energy, which is roughly flat this year, and Energen, down 8.5 percent since the start of 2017. Investment bank Simmons &amp; Company counts Concho Resources among its favorite exploration and production companies. Shares of the Permian basin oil producer plunged after it reported earnings on Tuesday, but Simmons said high expectations overshadowed strong financial results and guidance for 2017. Simmons highlighted Concho's plans to boost oil production by 25 percent this year, stronger-than-expected cash flow and strong hedging, or insurance against falling crude prices. The stock is up 0.5 percent year to date, leading many of its peers. Among the larger exploration and production companies, Iberia Capital Partners considers Anadarko Petroleum an outperformer for its ""superior asset base"" and ""smoother growth ramp as the industry comes out of the down cycle."" The stock is down 5.4 percent this year, but Iberia thinks Anadarko's exploration efforts can generate long-term growth and its portfolio of oil and gas assets allows the company to lower development costs while increasing returns. Iberia is also cautious on new Permian players. The firm said investment in long-term projects ""continues to be under-appreciated by those that are too busy stampeding like lemmings into the Permian Basin.""","[Some, drillers, Mizuho, buy, rating, established, Permian, player, Diamondback, Energy, roughly, flat, Energen, percent, start, Investment, bank, Simmons, amp, Company, Concho, Resources, favorite, exploration, production, company, Shares, Permian, basin, oil, producer, plunged, reported, earnings, Tuesday, Simmons, said, expectation, overshadowed, financial, drillers, Mizuho, buy, rating, established, Permian, player, Diamondback, Energy, roughly, flat, Energen, percent, start, Investment, bank, Simmons, amp, Company, Concho, Resources, favorite, exploration, production, company, Shares, Permian, basin, oil, producer, plunged, reported, earnings, Tuesday, Simmons, said, expectation, overshadowed, financial, result, production, company, Shares, Permian, basin, oil, producer, plunged, reported, earnings, Tuesday, Simmons, said, expectation, overshadowed, financial, result, guidance, Simmons, highlighted, ...]",1.0

As part of the partnership, IBM has signed a deal to deploy the Salesforce Service Cloud for internal use there. The value of the deal and proposed pricing of the joint products were not disclosed. The deal has several parts. Among the most notable: Both companies, like many others in the tech industry, are making investments in artificial intelligence and machine learning, by which computer programs attempt to connect data in new ways to provide new kinds of insights and assistance to users, and both frequently cite the importance of AI in their sales pitches to customers. IBM Watson suffered some bad publicity in February, however, when University of Texas auditors released a scathing report on a high-profile project involving Watson at MD Anderson hospital and placed the project on hold, although they cautioned that the decision ""should not be interpreted as an opinion on the scientific basis or functional capabilities of the system in its current state.""

The stock sunk more than 5 percent Tuesday following a downgrade from Deutsche Bank citing ""increasing uncertainty"" surrounding ongoing disruptions at one of the company's major copper mines. But the recent weakness could present a prime buying opportunity, according to Craig Johnson, managing director and technical market strategist at Piper Jaffray. ""I think the world has forgotten that this is a new secular bull market, and cyclical growth stocks are back in. When I look at a chart of Freeport-McMoRan here, what a great bottoming setup here. It's your classic inverted head and shoulders bottom,"" Johnson said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Power Lunch.""  Let us translate: A ""head and shoulders"" technical pattern typically points to a bullish-to-bearish reversal in a chart, and thus an inverted pattern would suggest Freeport-McMoRan could take a leg higher, on this technical basis. Examining a two-year chart of the stock, Johnson contended, ""All we're doing is pulling back and retesting where we broke out from,"" adding that he would buy this pullback as it's a ""great opportunity."" Johnson also noted that he thinks the basic materials sector will prove to be a market leader throughout 2017. Freeport-McMoRan, based in Arizona but with international copper, gold and silver mining operations, is up more than 7 percent year to date. The company saw significant upside, along with the price of copper, after the U.S. election in November as investors anticipated an increase in federal infrastructure spending. Production halted Tuesday at the giant Grasberg mine in Indonesia, where Freeport-McMoRan mines copper, after a failed deal between mine workers and the Indonesian government. The recent developments at the mine come as no surprise to Chris LaFemina, equity research analyst at Jefferies. But he said he is concerned about the ongoing dispute and expects shares to see volatility due to the recent reports. ""[Grasberg mine] is critically important to Freeport, and a resolution to the ongoing issues is an important component of the Freeport investment case in the near term,"" LaFemina told CNBC in an email Tuesday. Looking further out, ""assuming there is some resolution (even if as a result of international arbitration), the Freeport investment case is more dependent on the copper price,"" LaFemina wrote. He is bullish on the price of copper, and therefore holds a positive view on Freeport-McMoRan while acknowledging such volatility. China is one of the world's largest copper consumers, and its demand for the industrial metal is high. But Chad Morganlander, portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors, is staying away from Freeport-McMoRan at this juncture as he sees growth in China as ready to ""decelerate."" ""We think China's going to roll over, hence that's the reason we'd be more cautious,"" he said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Power Lunch."" ""It's had a huge run in the last 12 months, and that's on the back of copper prices surging over 30 percent year over year,"" he said Tuesday. Morganlander also noted that Freeport-McMoRan has about $19 billion in debt, and has a ""highly volatile revenue line"" with little consistency on its free cash flow side. Analysts currently give Freeport-McMoRan an average rating of hold, per FactSet data, with a slightly bullish average target price of $14.56.

The company's sales at North American stores open at least a year rose 3 percent, its third consecutive quarterly rise, beating analysts' estimate of 2.4 percent, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. However, the company said it expected revenue in 2017 to rise in the low single-digit range due to a stronger dollar. Coach had previously forecast low to mid-single-digit growth in revenue. ""Coach is executing well,"" ROE Equity Research analyst Laura Champine told Reuters. ""Revenue guidance is lower solely on foreign exchange shifts, so this is not related to business fundamentals.""

""We need the excess to show up for somebody to stomp on it, usually the Fed, and that's not in sight,"" Doll told ""Squawk Box."" ""If we get a head of steam in growth, ironically, it could shorten the cycle. But I think we've got a long time before we have to worry about that.""    Doll said financial stocks are experiencing an especially good run on hopes of a ""better economy, higher interest rates, [and] some rollback in legislation."" The strategist said he favored ""big global players,"" such as Bank of America and Goldman Sachs.    ""Financials started doing better on Brexit Monday, accelerated post the election, and while maybe a little ahead of themselves in the short term, I assume they're going to do well this year,"" Doll said.    What to stay away from as we enter a pro-growth presidency?    ""Stocks that look like bonds did phenomenally well during the stagnant growth period,"" Doll said. ""Utilities, a perfect example.

Once loved for their safety, yields, and low volatility levels, ""they have underperformed since the middle of last year,"" the strategist said. ""[And] there's more underperformance to come.""    But markets will soon need more clarity from President Donald Trump on his legislative priorities as he begins his first 100 days in office, Doll said.    ""Wall Street love[s] the idea that we have a pro-growth president, but we had a press conference, we had an inaugural address, and he really didn't talk about those issues, and I think that's caused a little bit of a sag,"" Doll said.    Doll said Trump will have to work with congressional Republicans to centralize the priorities of the Republican agenda and cut through the noise.    ""I think the market's saying, 'I made a list: trade deals, tax cuts, tax reform, repatriation, Obamacare, Supreme Court, immigration, ISIS, fight the press, infrastructure,'"" Doll said.

MRK,"Merck & Company, Inc.",4:Cramer Remix: How drug stocks fulfilled their destiny without Trump,"Tuesday, 28 Feb 2017 |  7:21  PM ET","  Many investors assume that President Donald Trump's meeting with pharmaceutical executives back in January is behind the tremendous run that these stocks have had, but Jim Cramer pointed to something else. ""Let's recognize that some moves are simply related to bonds, and bonds aren't in the grips of the economy, they are being driven by this bizarre shortage of bonds from the developed world,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. Short sellers built up positions ahead of the meeting with Trump, betting that the stocks would go down afterward. After all, Trump had campaigned against outrageous sums that the U.S. government paid drug companies. But the drug companies came to the table with powerful statistics surrounding employment, and after the meeting Trump began praising the executives and moved on to the next group. But just because the group bottomed, doesn't mean that explains the rally. When Cramer studied the gains of Merck, Eli Lilly and Pfizer, he discovered that they simply rose because they were bond market equivalents. High-yielding dividend stocks followed bonds. As the bond prices rose and bond yields fell, investors crowded into them for income. Cramer witnessed the most violent contrast in earnings he has seen in ages on Tuesday when Domino's Pizza crushed estimates, while Target gave a forecast that was far worse than expected. These two stocks are a perfect metaphor for the current environment of the stock market, thanks to what Cramer calls the ""stay-at-home economy."" This refers to thriving stocks — such as Amazon, Netflix and Domino's — that allow people to stay at home and save money. Domino's delivers pizza and can be accessed from almost every device to order from home. Target requires people to leave the house and go to the store. Its prices aren't anything special, certainly not what they can get from Amazon, which delivers right to its customer's door for free if they are an Amazon Prime member. ""We have to question the entire relevance of Target, particularly if prices go up 20 to 25 percent … Three-year plan? How about a survival plan. There is no long-game anymore,"" Cramer said. As the market eagerly awaits the IPO of Snap, the parent company of the popular Snapchat app, Cramer reviewed his playbook for investors to make a move at the right time. ""I totally get where the bears are coming from, but I believe that, at least initially, the bulls are going to triumph here, and they could potentially keep winning for a whole lot longer than that,"" the "" he said. A typical daily average user of Snapchat visits the app more than 18 times a day for about 20 to 30 minutes of total activity. With the astounding 158 million people that use Snapchat, there are more than 2.5 billion snaps a day. According to Snapchat, the average user age ranges from 18 to 34 years old. While the online lending space has become a difficult place to be, SoFi is a privately held company that Cramer said is the one doing it right. SoFi started as an online lender that would refinance student loans taken out by graduates of elite universities, and has since expanded to personal loans, mortgage lending, asset management and life insurance. SoFi's business model is customized to offer customers career advice and even offers dating events to keep customers engaged. It has no fees, and its lending process has been simplified online. In just six short years it has funded $16 billion in loans, and just closed on a $500 million round in funding. Cramer spoke with SoFi's co-founder and CEO Mike Cagney, who explained what makes the company different. ""It's really the opportunity to reinvent how financial services work. It's the idea to bring speed, transparency and alignment into the equation. And that's what's missing today,"" Cagney said. Shares of Salesforce fell in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the company reported a robust quarter, but forward guidance was lighter than Wall Street expectations. Co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff explained the conservative guidance to Cramer, citing a shift in the foreign exchange atmosphere. In September, Benioff also pointed to foreign exchange headwinds for weaker forward guidance back in September, due to Brexit and said it resulted in a loss of $150 million in revenue. ""We just reported an unbelievable year. But our results can be tempered by the foreign exchange environments. So we are appropriately conservative when we give you those numbers,"" Benioff said. In the Lightning Round, Cramer gave his take on a few stocks from callers: Southwestern Energy Company: ""You are buying it betting that it's going to get real hot this summer because the fact is, it did not work this year because it was just too hot in the winter. And that's why that stock has gone down along with the whole group."" NetApp: ""It had a monster quarter and I think the stock can go higher. I really liked that quarter. Everything about it.""","[statistic, surrounding, employment, meeting, Trump, began, praising, executive, moved, group, But, group, bottomed, mean, explains, rally, When, Cramer, studied, gain, Merck, Eli, Lilly, Pfizer, discovered, simply, market, equivalent, High, yielding, dividend, followed, As, price, yield, investor, crowded, income, Cramer, witnessed, Cramer, said, As, market, eagerly, awaits, IPO, Snap, company, popular, Snapchat, app, Cramer, reviewed, playbook, investor, make, move, right, time, I, totally, get, bear, coming, I, believe, initially, bull, going, triumph, potentially, keep, winning, lot, longer, said, A, typical, average, awaits, IPO, Snap, company, popular, Snapchat, app, Cramer, reviewed, playbook, investor, make, move, right, time, I, totally, get, bear, coming, ...]",1.0

""It's very pleasant for us that energy occupies first place on the new administration's program,"" said Novak.     ""We believe that for the industry as a whole this is good because the energy sector should develop and the fact that a large country, the largest country in economic terms, such as the USA will be developing its energy is overall a positive thing for the whole of the energy sector,"" he said. Over the weekend, the Kremlin said it was working on arranging a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump.  ""It won't happen in a matter of weeks"" said Dmitry Peskov in an interview with the BBC. ""Let's hope that it can happen in the months to come"" Novak also welcomed Trump's appointment of Rex Tillerson, the former head of Exxon, as the next Secretary of State.  ""Rex Tillerson is a very famous energy industry specialist and I am certain that his actions will be positive, as a whole, for the industry"" ‎ While Novak refused to be drawn out on whether Trump's energy plan could drive prices lower, he told CNBC he believed oil would trade between $50-$60 a barrel over the next 12 months.  In his inaugural address on Friday, Trump said he was committed to achieving energy independence from the OPEC oil-producing cartel and any nation hostile to U.S. interests. Novak told CNBC there was nothing surprising in America wanting to do this.  ""That is absolutely normal,"" he said, ""That works for some with the availability of natural mineral resources""  During a wide-ranging interview, Novak said he hoped relations with the U.S. would get better.  When asked whether a Trump presidency was good for Russia, he responded ""I think we can hope that relations will improve."" Russia's energy minister added he believed the EU and U.S. sanctions have been bad for both Russian and foreign oil majors such as Exxon Mobil, Total, BP and Statoil.   ""You know it wasn't us who imposed sanctions and so the initiative for their removal should come from those who imposed them."" Novak's comments come as a bi-partisan group of U.S. senators announced over the weekend that they were working on a bill that could limit the President's ability to weaken sanctions on Russia. ""The question is undoubtedly a political one,"" Novak told CNBC.   ""But the people who can answer best of all...about how these sanctions play out from the point of view of the operations of their companies the heads of these companies and the representatives of these companies. We are constantly hearing from the business community today these sanctions are beneficial to nobody""  Novak also made clear Russia was ready to meet demand for gas from Europe, where he expects domestic production. ""Over many years Russia has advocated itself as a reliable supplier of energy resources and gas and I would even say has acted as a guaranteed supplier, when there was a break in supply from other countries, other suppliers of gas to Europe, Russia has always covered deficits that arise as a result of a lack of Europe's own resource supply. And for this Russia has the capacity, the reserves to supply gas. Therefore, we believe that the relations between the producers and consumers of energy resources have been reliable and we are ready to keep supporting them.""

TTWO,"Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.",3:Cramer Remix: The reason you would be an idiot to sell Disney,"Wednesday,  8 Feb 2017 |  7:34  PM ET","Sometimes Jim Cramer finds himself praying that Disney CEO Bob Iger never retires, because he makes it so hard for investors to sell the stock. ""Iger's calming words about business on the conference call reversed a substantial decline and turned it into a small advance,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. Iger performed his magic by telling investors about all of the tremendous events and special things that will be added to the bottom line if investors hung on to Disney's stock. It made Cramer feel like he was about to miss the opening of the biggest movie ever. Even better, Iger topped it off with a monster buyback, which seems to accelerate whenever the stock is down. Disney repurchased 15 million shares for approximately $1.5 billion last quarter, with plans to buy another $7 to $8 billion in the rest of the year. ""It's like Iger was saying, you want to sell Disney off of ESPN? Go ahead … I'll make more money off of you than you ever dreamed of,"" Cramer said. Cramer hears worries every day that stocks are now overvalued, but still maintains that stocks aren't as outrageously priced versus other rallies in the past. ""The valuations are pretty darned reasonable, but I have a hard time proving it to people because we are in an incredibly visceral, polarizing moment stemming from the election of a pro-business president who seems to rack up an incredible amount of baggage on a daily basis,"" he said. To prove that stocks are not overvalued once and for all, Cramer compared the top companies that dominated the market back in 1999, when the market was last on the verge of collapsing due to true overvaluation. He ultimately found that five of the six largest companies right now all have justified fundamentals, with the only outlier being Amazon, which Cramer said cannot be confined to a spreadsheet. While many companies are scrambling to create more jobs in the U.S. to satisfy President Donald Trump's hiring agenda, General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt isn't sweating it. ""We create great jobs here when we sell our products every place, and I think the president knows that,"" Immelt said. Immelt also said he likes what Trump is doing so far when it comes to infrastructure, tax reform and regulatory reform. He plans to help Trump in any way that he can, and intends to lead by example. Infact, Immelt said his company has been navigating the world on its own, and is happy to continue doing that without help from Washington. ""We don't have to go through Washington on our way to be global. We are global. We've got people all over the world,"" Immelt said. Many investors also fret what Trump's next move will be for the drug industry, but there's one stock that Cramer says it the best run and fastest growing member of the group, and he owns it in his charitable trust. Allergan is the pharmaceutical company with franchises in the dermatology, eye care, women's health and cardiovascular disease categories, among others. Cramer was astounded when Allergan blew away the numbers when it reported on Wednesday. The company also has a strong pipeline, thanks to a series of small acquisitions. Cramer spoke with Allergan's chairman and CEO Brent Saunders, who said the strong focus on research and development have helped the company's success. ""We have been really focused on R&amp;D. No one was really paying attention when we were doing it, but we have been really focused,"" Saunders said. Take Two interactive is best known as the developer of the video game ""Grand Theft Auto,"" but Cramer said the proof is in the pudding when it comes to this company's strength. The company hasn't released a new ""Grand Theft Auto"" title in three years, yet the stock has managed to almost double in the past two years. Take Two reported a solid quarter on Tuesday, with a 51.2 percent gain in bookings, which is typically the best way to judge the company's health. Even though Take Two lowered its full-year revenue forecast, that was simply because of new federal guidelines that require it to defer some gaming revenue based on how long the users play the games. Cramer spoke with Take-Two's CEO Strauss Zelnick, who explained how the company is still reaping the benefits of ""Grand Theft Auto's"" free online version of the game. ""When you're in the game you can add virtual currency. When we drop new great content into the game, it increases engagement, that increases virtual currency sales. So, we just had a record quarter for recurrent consumer spending, and that was partially driven by 'Grand Theft Auto' online,"" Zelnick said. In the lightning round, Cramer gave his take on a few stocks from callers: BlackRock: ""All that stock seems to do over time is give you a good dividend, go up a lot and makes you a lot of money. I think you've got to stick with it."" Macquarie Infrastructure Corp: ""It's got a good yield. I know people like infrastructure. I am not going to endorse it because I've got to find out why it took such a big hit.

GS,"Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (The)",49:Indonesia to hold court hearing into Goldman Sachs's billion-dollar dispute with tycoon,"Monday,  6 Feb 2017 |  7:20  PM ET","Indonesia will hold a court hearing on Tuesday into a billion-dollar dispute between Goldman Sachs and a local tycoon, who says the Wall Street giant's unit unlawfully sold shares he owned, in the latest test for the country's legal system. Goldman took the unusual step of counter-suing the tycoon - Benny Tjokrosaputro - for reputational damage. The hearing on Tuesday will give the retail-to-property businessman a chance to rebuff Goldman's assertion. The dispute comes at a time when Indonesia, Southeast Asia's largest economy, is embarking on its biggest drive for foreign investment in a decade. Legal experts say the outcome could give an indication on whether the country's civil court proceedings will protect the rights of foreigners. Indonesia's government has recently raised investor concerns by cutting business ties with JPMorgan over a negative research report and partially reversing a mining policy. Goldman's prospects at the hearing could be affected by a general lack of transparency in Indonesian court proceedings, said Bill Sullivan, senior foreign counsel at Indonesian law firm Christian Teo &amp; Partners. ""This lack of transparency can result in very surprising decisions, especially when you have a foreign party seeking recovery from a well-resourced and well-connected local party,"" Sullivan told Reuters in an email. Goldman's dispute with Tjokrosaputro, president director of property developer PT Hanson International, stems from an arcane area of the financial market in which individuals or firms pledge shares in return for short-term loans, according to court documents and people familiar with the matter. Tjokrosaputro had pledged 425 million Hanson shares to U.S. hedge fund Platinum Partners in return for a loan on the basis that he could get the shares back upon repayment - an arrangement known as a repurchase agreement or a repo. Goldman's unit, Goldman Sachs International, bought the Hanson shares from Platinum as a hedge for the derivatives it had entered into with the fund, a bank spokesman said. In late 2014, New York-based Platinum fell into financial difficulties and had trouble paying back a large number of investors, according to U.S. authorities who recently charged top executives of the fund with running a $1 billion fraud. Goldman started selling the Hanson shares last year, but was forced to stop after Tjokrosaputro filed a police complaint. He went on to sue Goldman in September for 15 trillion rupiah ($1.1 billion), alleging the transaction was conducted ""unlawfully"". Tjokrosaputro's lawyer told Reuters his client did not breach his contract with Platinum and that no-one other than Tjokrosaputro had the right to own or sell the shares. In response, Goldman countersued the tycoon last month for at least $1.1 billion claiming reputational damage. Goldman ""lawfully"" acquired the shares from Platinum through the negotiated board of the Indonesian Stock Exchange and the transactions were validly settled, the bank says in its claim documents. A bank spokesman told Reuters that Goldman Sachs International was not aware of Tjokrosaputro's dealings with Platinum, nor any restrictions on the shares it purchased.

BX,The Blackstone Group L.P.,"11:Early movers: BAC, BLK, NFLX, FB, GOOGL, BA, P, Z & more","Friday, 13 Jan 2017 |  7:54  AM ET","  Check out which companies are making headlines before the bell:   Bank of America — The bank earned 40 cents per share for the fourth quarter, two cents a share above estimates. Revenue was slightly short of forecasts. BofA's results were helped by a sharp reduction in expenses.  BlackRock — The asset manager earned an adjusted $5.14 per share for the fourth quarter, 12 cents a share above estimates. Revenue was very slight below Street forecasts, but the firm was helped by lower expenses and a rush into low-cost ETFs. BlackRock also approved a 9 percent dividend hike and additional share repurchases.  Comcast — The NBCUniversal and CNBC parent's shares were upgraded to ""buy"" from ""hold"" at Deutsche Bank, saying the company would benefit from decreased regulation and tax reform.  Netflix — Netflix was upgraded to ""hold"" from ""sell"" at Deutsche Bank, which said it had based its ""sell"" rating on the stock being two years ahead of where it should be. However, it now sees better subscriber growth thanks to strength in international markets.  Facebook — Raymond James upgraded Facebook to ""strong buy"" from ""outperform,"" based continued strength in ad spending and improved results for advertisers, among other factors.  Pandora Media — The online music service announced a seven percent workforce reduction and that its fourth quarter revenue will exceed its prior guidance. Pandora is seeing increases in both advertisements and paid subscribers, helping boost its results.  Separately, the New York Post is reporting that SiriusXM is still interested in Pandora at the right price.  MetLife, Unum — The insurers both received approval from Florida's insurance commissioner to raise premiums for long term care insurance. The increases will be phased in over a three-year period and will then be guaranteed for an additional seven years.  Alphabet — Alphabet confirmed that it has shut down its ""Titan"" project, an effort to provide internet service from drones. The Google parent shut down Titan early last year, although it has only now acknowledged the move.  Anadarko Petroleum — Anadarko is selling South Texas oil and gas assets to Sanchez Energy and Blackstone Group for $2.3 billion. The Wall Street Journal had reported back in October that such a deal was in the works.  Fiat Chrysler — The company's shares are rebounding in overseas trading, after plunging Thursday on EPA accusations that its software allowed an improper level of emissions in its diesel vehicles. The automaker denied the allegations and said it would contest the EPA's findings.  Boeing — Boeing received a 100-jet order from India-based budget airline SpiceJet. The carrier is buying Boeing's MAX 737 jet, with the deal including an option for 50 more.  Mobileye — Mobileye was rated buy in new coverage at Jefferies, with the firm noting the maker of autonomous driving technology has favorable market positioning.  WPX Energy — WPX will buy assets in the Permian basin for $775 million, with the oil and gas producer saying it would partly fund the purchase through an equity sale.  Zillow — Morgan Stanley downgraded the real estate website operator's stock to ""equal weight"" from ""overweight,"" saying it appears fairly valued and that under current circumstances Zillow will find it difficult to generate further significant drivers.","[Check, company, making, headline, Bank, America, The, bank, earned, cent, share, cent, share, estimate, Revenue, slightly, forecast, BofA, result, helped, reduction, expense, BlackRock, The, asset, manager, headline, Bank, America, The, bank, earned, cent, share, cent, share, estimate, Revenue, slightly, forecast, BofA, result, helped, reduction, expense, BlackRock, The, asset, manager, earned, adjusted, share, cent, share, estimate, Revenue, slight, Street, forecast, firm, helped, expense, cost, ETFs, BlackRock, approved, share, estimate, Revenue, slight, Street, forecast, firm, helped, expense, cost, ETFs, BlackRock, approved, percent, dividend, hike, additional, share, repurchase, Comcast, The, NBCUniversal, CNBC, share, upgraded, buy, hold, Deutsche, Bank, saying, company, benefit, decreased, regulation, ...]",1.0

LLY,Eli Lilly and Company,5:Cramer warns pharma still not safe to own despite Trump’s softened stance,"Tuesday, 31 Jan 2017 |  6:50  PM ET","  Jim Cramer was prepared for President Donald Trump to go into his meeting with top pharmaceutical executives on Monday with a baseball bat in hand.   Instead, he merely jawboned them about charging less for drugs.    The U.S. government is the biggest buyer of drugs in the world. It has tremendous bargaining power, Cramer said, but chooses not to use it. Instead, it lets the drug companies decide pricing; this in contrary to almost every other country in the world.    It was clear to Cramer that Trump doesn't want to do that, which for the first time seemed at odds with the message he campaigned on.    ""This is an important departure for a president who has been sticking to his guns on his campaign promises,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.   Cramer also wondered if Vice President Pence, who was previously the governor of Indiana and a great defender of Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly, could have pointed out the good the industry does. If the government uses its bargaining power to push prices too low, pharmaceutical companies would spend less money developing new drugs.    This time, however, Cramer didn't hear Trump utter the phrase that big pharma is getting away with murder. Instead, he used the ""carrot and stick"" approach for negotiating and told the companies if they build plants and hire in the U.S., he will support a faster-track FDA to lower the cost of the approval process for new drugs.   Trump may have softened his tone, but he still made it clear he will not tolerate astronomical price increases. Cramer wasn't shocked by this as many executives are already coming to grips with this.    ""Even if the president is about to go to war with big pharma, this industry still has too many negatives to get in bed with,"" Cramer said.    Lack of innovation, growth and cyclical rotations were his chief concerns, followed by disappointments from companies like Bristol-Myers and the erosion of Valeant.    With Trump in office, Cramer has been adamant that the top two industries that should be avoided are pharmaceuticals and retail, and the meeting on Monday didn't make him budge on that stance.    In the past, there have been long periods of time when it didn't make sense to own bank stocks, industrials or oil stocks. This time it's retail and pharma.   ""Right now avoiding these two sectors — retail and pharma — seems like a real good idea, unless you have special situations, even if Trump didn't put the wood to big pharma in today's now seemingly regularly scheduled executive pageant,"" Cramer said.

M,Macy's Inc,33:Support for Donald Trump sparks fresh boycott talk at another retailer,"Thursday, 12 Jan 2017 | 11:40  AM ET","  It isn't just automakers and drug companies getting pulled into the political ring.    The retail industry on Thursday was once again dragged into the crosshairs, after President-elect Donald Trump sent out a tweet thanking L.L Bean heiress Linda Bean for her support.     The Republican granddaughter of L.L. Bean's founder had appeared on the Fox News program ""Fox &amp; Friends"" earlier that morning to defend her donations to the Trump campaign.       After news broke last week saying Linda Bean had donated too much money to a political action committee in favor of Trump, many customers called for a boycott of the L.L. Bean brand. Bean, who has served on the company's board for decades, said those calls are ""very much a case of bullying.""     ""It's bullying me, it's bullying the companies that I own,"" she told Fox News, adding that a family member's donation to Barack Obama's campaign did not lead to similar outrage.   L.L. Bean is just the latest retailer to grab attention over politics. When Macy's recently reported another period of declining sales, some on social media claimed the chain's poor performance was the result of boycotts.     Macy's has raised the ire of consumers on both sides of the aisle. It is one of dozens of retailers being targeted by the #GrabYourWallet campaign, for its decision to continue carrying Ivanka Trump's line. In 2015, however, the chain cut ties with Donald Trump after comments he made regarding Latinos. That prompted Trump supporters to pledge to stop shopping at Macy's.   ""Macy's is a company that stands for diversity and inclusion,"" the company said in a statement at the time. New Balance is also on #GrabYourWallet's list. Some of that brand's customers burned their shoes shortly after the election, when an executive said things were moving in the right direction under Trump.    L.L. Bean has taken a public stance against associating its brand, which has a manufacturing facility in Maine, with politics.    ""We were disappointed to learn that Grab Your Wallet is advocating a boycott against L.L.Bean solely because Linda Bean, who is only one of 50+ family members involved with the business, personally supported Donald Trump for president,"" the company said in a statement.  ""L.L.Bean does not endorse political candidates, take positions on political matters, or make political contributions. Simply put, we stay out of politics.""","[committee, favor, Trump, customer, called, boycott, L, L, Bean, Bean, served, company, decade, said, call, bullying, It, bullying, bullying, company, I, told, Fox, News, adding, family, member, donation, Barack, Obama, campaign, lead, similar, outrage, L, L, Bean, latest, retailer, grab, News, adding, family, member, donation, Barack, Obama, campaign, lead, similar, outrage, L, L, Bean, latest, retailer, grab, attention, politics, When, Macy, recently, reported, period, declining, social, medium, claimed, chain, poor, performance, result, boycott, Macy, raised, ire, consumer, aisle, It, dozen, Bean, latest, retailer, grab, attention, politics, When, Macy, recently, reported, period, declining, social, medium, claimed, chain, poor, performance, result, boycott, ...]",0.0

The company is planning to dedicate 500 square footage of space, with a majority of the shops located in the men's department, according to a statement released on Wednesday.    ""Nike is immensely popular across all categories and with the rapid rise of activewear and athletic shoes, we want to have the best expression of Nike in any department store,"" John Tighe, chief merchant for J.C.
